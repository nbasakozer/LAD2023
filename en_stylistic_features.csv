2,13:00:49,Opinion: Chinese students wonder if Biden can engage Xi with curiosity,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/14/opinion-chinese-students-wonder-if-biden-can-engage-xi-with-curiosity/,"Hopes and fears have soared in the run-up to President Biden’s sit down with China’s leader, Xi Jinpeng, set for Wednesday in San Francisco. Not since the Vietnam War has America’s diplomatic dance with the People’s Republic fractured so many toes. One ray of hope shines bright — the more than 300,000 Chinese students who attend American universities, signaling the generosity of both governments. These young scholars enliven my classroom and enrich research programs around the country. Many come away with warm affection for America: our free press and raucous debates, our music and movies, even calling professors by their first name. Still, the backdrop to the Biden-Xi summit remains ominous. In recent months, the U.S. has shot down China’s spy balloon floating across the Midwest, limited technologies exported to Beijing, and implored Xi to push his ally, Iran, to defuse the bloody Israeli-Hamas conflict. Protestors will greet Xi on his arrival to California, spotlighting his oppression of writers and religion. But the wide panorama of Chinese students in the America — acquainted with both societies — offers fresh lessons. I asked several across the nation hosted by colleagues what hopes these young scholars hold for this week’s Bay Area gathering. Here’s what I heard: • Yi. Biden should express “deep respect for (Xi’s) family heritage, his father a notable figure in Chinese history (a military hero, then distributed land to rural peasants). He is quite stubborn and firmly believes in his convictions.” Biden should be “eager to advance cooperation with China openly and sincerely (in) the economy, education and health care.” • Zhang. “Opening markets would be a good thing, the return of Google. When my mother had chemotherapy, the better medicine from the U.S., with fewer side effects, was no longer available.” • Hui. “Xi emphasizes our confidence in traditional (Confucian) culture, that is, how we view the modernization process with Chinese characteristics. Traditional wisdom emphasizes harmony and development. These are common values (shared by both nations).” • Li. “The narrative in China is that America is a big bully, intervening into others’ domestic affairs. Maybe nudges are seen as condescending. I very much hope they can build trust.” • Zixi. “China should avoid misrepresenting or vilifying the U.S. in global discourse. I desire greater collaboration and mutual respect, particularly among younger generations.” America “should invite more Chinese students, perhaps with a tuition discount.” Overall, the students with whom I spoke revealed a certain savvy, expressing realpolitik over material rivalries. But they also hunger for mutual respect, for Americans to learn about their history and age-old cultural values, such as nurturing harmony and discounting oneself to cooperatively build civil society. Washington remains obsessed with stratospheric interests, such as selling semiconductors to China, cultivating allies that surround the People’s Republic. White House advisors briefed reporters last week, objectifying the Chinese people, dryly suggesting that Biden seeks to “manage the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict.” Instead, these students invite Americans to rise above cultural caricature and grim narratives of geopolitical combat. They yearn to know us better and for us to reach out to them.",top,united states of america,0.5523809523809524,630,34,18.529411764705884,47.78

""Is killing more Palestinians, is killing more than 11,000 Palestinians going to produce the peace and security that we all want for both Palestinians and Israelis? Or is it going to push the region further into hatred and despair and hopelessness?"" Mr Safadi said on 7.30. The deputy prime minister spoke to just days after Jordan joined a summit of Arab leaders urging fan immediate ceasefire in the Middle East. ""One of the outcomes of the Arab League and Muslim summit was to entrust the Secretariat of both organisations to start preparing files to document Israeli war crimes with a view to take legal action in international courts."" ""Pushing 67 per cent of Gaza's population to 56 per cent of the area of Gaza, to an area that doesn't have basic necessities, doesn't have enough hospitals, clinics or water."" ""That means concentrating 2.3 million people in an area that cannot sustain them, which would mean more misery … more hopelessness. And that is not going to be an environment in which calls for peace will thrive. I think this is another war crime."" Hospitals in Gaza have become a flashpoint in the fighting, with the Israeli Defence Force claiming Hamas uses health facilities to hide its military operations. Yesterday it released footage it claimed was filmed in Gaza's now deserted Rantisi hospital showing weapons, a tunnel entrance and a hideout used to hold hostages. The ABC has not been able to verify the footage. Mr Safadi said the claim needed to be verified by ""an independent entity"". ""It's going to be extremely hard for anybody in this part of the world to believe the claims of an army that has brought hell on 2.3 million people,"" he said. Mr Safadi said the conflict will lead to a perpetuation of violence in the region. ""This war is not just killing innocent Palestinians and destroying their livelihoods. It's creating an environment of hate."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza after the war for Israel's security. Last week on 7.30 Netanyahu adviser Mark Regev said elements of that military presence could be similar to the West Bank. Jordan's deputy prime minister rejected the idea. As Israeli forces press deeper into Gaza on their mission to destroy Hamas, the enclave's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a focal point. ""What we've been seeing very clearly is that approaching this conflict from a pure security zone, as if the assumption is that you can just suffocate people's aspirations for freedom, and then we can move ahead with that, that doesn't work,"" he said before calling for a permanent, two-state solution. ""What we all in the Arab world are saying is that there needs to be a comprehensive, immediate move to settle this conflict once and for all … address the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, and address Israel's right to security."" He also warned that the current war could expand rapidly due to tensions in the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. ""The West Bank is boiling as a result of Israeli operational measures there … you have other fronts, particularly the Lebanese-Israeli border, we're seeing tension rising there. I think unless this war stops, we're looking at the very real threat of this war expanding and dragging this whole region into the abyss of this ugly conflict."" Do you know more about this story?

The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats.

The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high.

In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital.

According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status.

Marking the worst start in the history of the , the film is said to have underperformed due to lacklustre buzz and star being unable to promote the film or do any interviews, due to the now-ended actors' strike in Hollywood. Of course, there's also the case of superhero movie fatigue, with dwindling interest in the genre causing audiences to be pickier about what they're spending money on. It has been a less than stellar year for Marvel. from earlier this year was heavily panned by critics and fans alike for its poor CGI effects, and its Secret Invasion show hasn't fared well either. The newest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) made $47 million (about Rs. 391 crore) within the US and Canada, with initially hoping to debut with a $75 million (about Rs. 624 crore) collection in the region. has also struggled internationally, simply earning $63.3 million (about Rs. 527 crore), against a total production budget of $200 million (about Rs. 1,664 crore). According to , as usual, China was among the top contributors, though not by a huge margin, grossing $11.7 million (about Rs. 97 crore) in ticket sales. Following in close second is the UK with $4.3 million (about Rs. 35 crore) in earnings, while the Indonesian region adds $3.7 million (about Rs. 39 crore) to the pot. South Korea comes fourth, a little short of Indonesia's numbers at $3.5 million (about Rs. 29 crore), while France takes the no. 5 spot, having earned $3.1 million (about Rs. 25 crore). Directed by Nia DaCosta, The Marvels fell short of expectations critically as well, earning a 62 percent rating on aggregator website , with many calling out its cluttered storyline. This could be attributed to the four weeks of reshoots the film underwent, while its director headed out to work on another movie during the post-production stage. DaCosta attested this claim, adding that her last-minute departure wasn't ‘dramatic' and that by then, everyone involved knew what the final cut of The Marvels was supposed to be. “For me personally, it was that they moved the date of the film four different times,” she said in an . “They knew the entire time that I had an obligation—a green-lit movie with people who were waiting for me. And I pushed that and then I pushed it again and then I pushed it again.” It also doesn't help that The Marvels opened the same day dropped its latest movie , serving as the acclaimed filmmaker's return to a thriller genre since 2019's . The film was readily accessible on a streaming platform and therefore, it's plausible to assume that audiences trusted Fincher's namesake and chose to watch that instead. Serving as a direct sequel to 2019's , The Marvels is set in a destabilised universe where Carol Danvers (Larson), Kamala Khan ( ), and Captain Monica Rambeau's ( ) power get tangled, forcing them to synergise and thwart the evil Kree imperialist Dar-Benn.

After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls.

The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Under the constant threat of bombardment in Gaza since October 7, Amal’s daily struggle to support her family has become a deadly assault course. She picks through the rubble between the school and her home in Shabura neighbourhood of Rafah in the south of Gaza, where she hopes to find neighbours with some flour to make bread. Her 24-year-old son Suleiman races to a nearby bakery first thing to grab a number in line, before hurrying to a water point. “I try to fill a canteen or two with water before getting back to the bakery before it opens,” said Suleiman. The tiring task “takes two hours, when you’re lucky, but more often four or five”, he said. There is no guarantee of success at the end, either. “We take turns in the line. Two days ago, I waited in the line for four and a half hours and when it was my turn, they told me there was no bread left. I begged them to give me just a few pieces for the children but they refused,” said his mother. Amal says the apartment block she lived in was destroyed by an Israeli bombardment on the first day of the war which followed Hamas’s attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s response has killed about 11,200 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. “Even the horse which pulled my son’s cart, his livelihood, was killed,” she said. The family spends the day in the rubble of what once was their home. Later, Amal is joined by her sister-in-law Nesrin, 39, who turns up holding up a small sack of flour like a trophy. The pair put themselves to work immediately, mixing the flour with water. One worked the dough, while the other scavenged in the rubble for pieces of cardboard and wood to make a fire to bake the flatbread. “Look at me! I’m helping, too!” said nine-year-old Bilal, laying out clothes to dry on slabs of concrete. What little water there is has to be used carefully, a little for washing clothes and some for a shower. “In general, the children and I wash every four or five days. Sometimes there is no water and we have to wait longer,” said Amal, gesturing to her bathroom, which still stood among the rubble. “It allows us to have a bit of privacy but we’re always worried a piece of concrete will fall on our heads,” she said. Her husband, Imed, tries to keep the children occupied, playing old Palestinian songs and some more modern tunes on the ney, the traditional Arab flute. “My oud was buried under the rubble but at least I have my flute to keep my spirits up and make the children smile,” he said. By the afternoon, the family had managed to secure 27 litres (seven gallons) of water, a 500-gram (18-ounce) bag of pasta and a packet of sauce – to be shared between some 50 people. “We start by feeding the children,” Imed said, as the younger members of the family lined up with their plates to get a few mouthfuls of food that quickly disappeared. After dinner, the parents poured themselves a cup of tea each. The little powdered tea they have left needs to last. With the sound of drones growing and darkness approaching, the family headed back to the UN school, where they sleep alongside thousands of others. “We do not have winter clothes for the children and each night now, it’s a little colder than the night before,” said Amal. “The children don’t sleep much and if they manage to sleep, they wake up in the night screaming,” added sister-in-law Nesrin. “So I spend the night waiting for the sunrise, so I can return close to home.”",top,united states of america,0.43252595155709345,867,35,24.771428571428572,79.972

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

According to the Landmine Monitor, 4,710 people were wounded or killed by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) across 49 states and two other areas last year. Civilians -- half of them children -- accounted for 85 percent of those casualties, it said. That official number of overall casualties was slightly lower than a year earlier, when 5,544 such casualties were recorded. But Mark Hiznay, the editor of the annual report, told reporters in Geneva that the drop last year was linked to ""a massive gap in recording for Afghanistan during 2022"". And co-author Loren Persi noted a dramatic increase in the number of casualties linked exclusively to landmines -- explosive devices intentionally placed above or underground that kill and wound people during and long after conflicts. ""The number of casualties recorded as specifically caused by antipersonnel landmines increased ... by just over 50 percent, to 628 in 2022 from 414 antipersonnel mine casualties in 2021,"" he told AFP. The report determined that the highest number of casualties recorded last year from both landmines and ERW was Syria, at 834. But it was perhaps the surging casualty numbers in Ukraine that was the most shocking. Amid Russia's full-scale invasion, which began in February last year, the number of civilians wounded or killed by landmines and explosive remnants of war in Ukraine soared more than 10-fold in 2022 to 608, up from 58 in 2021. Yemen and Myanmar both recorded more than 500 casualties in 2022, the report said. The Landmine Monitor report was released ahead of an annual meeting of state parties of the Mine Ban Treaty, which was adopted in 1997. That treaty, which currently counts 164 state parties, prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines, and requires that assistance be provided to victims, as well as mine clearance and stockpile destruction. ""The Mine Ban Treaty must be the cornerstone of all efforts to rid the world of antipersonnel mines,"" the head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Tamar Gabelnick, said in a statement. ""The only way communities will be truly safe from the scourge of these weapons is when all states have joined and are fully respecting the treaty."" The report found that 60 countries and other territories remain contaminated by landmines, including 33 state parties that have an obligation to actively pursue mine clearance. It cautioned that new use of the prohibited weapon represented one of the greatest challenges to the long-held norm against landmines. Myanmar and Russia, which are not state parties to the treaty, both deployed fresh landmines in 2022. Tuesday's report highlighted that Russia's extensive use of landmines in Ukraine had resulted in an ""unprecedented situation in which a country that is not party to the Mine Ban Treaty is using the weapon on the territory of a State Party"". It highlighted that Ukrainian authorities were also ""investigating the circumstances of its forces using antipersonnel mines"". Hiznay said there was ""credible evidence that the Ukrainian forces used antipersonnel mines in violation of the treaty in and around the city of Izyum during 2022, when the city was under Russian control"". Katrin Atkins, a senior researcher with the team, told reporters that Ukraine had requested a 10-year extension for its mine clearance deadline.

17,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679

(AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by Jewish peace activists calling for a cease fire in Gaza staged a sit-in inside of the federal building in Oakland, California, leading to multiple arrests. People wore T-shirts reading ""Jews Say Cease-fire Now” and carried banners that read “Not in Our Name” and “Let Gaza Live” in the rotunda of the Rondald V. Dellums Federal building on Monday evening. Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the protest organizers, posted online that dozens of people had been taken into custody by 9 p.m. Protesters were escorted outside of the building by U.S. Department of Homeland Security police. Messages were sent early Tuesday to the department and to Oakland police asking how many people were arrested and on what charges. “There is no other choice,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of Berkeley told KNTV-TV when explaining why she was at the sit-in. “How many people do we have to kill before we arrive at a cease fire?” The protest was part of a growing number across the country following fighting triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel , whose response has led to thousands of deaths — and much destruction — across Gaza. On Monday, hundreds of Jewish peace activists and their allies converged at a major train station in downtown Chicago during rush hour blocking the entrance to the Israeli consulate and demanding U.S. support for an Israel cease-fire. Jewish Voice for Peace led a similar sit-in in New York City’s Grand Central Station on Oct. 27, where a sea of protesters filled the main concourse during evening rush hour, chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip.

Xi, who is widely expected to deliver a speech, will be eager to convince US industry that China is still open for business after recording its first quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. (File) The dinner on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will follow a day of talks between Xi and US President Joe Biden, aimed at stabilizing fraught ties between the world's two largest economies. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. For American businesses, it will be a chance to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate China's economic slowdown, a US push to ""de-risk"" some American supply chains away from China, and uncertainty caused by expanding Chinese security rules. ""The purpose of the dinner is to foster better communication,"" one source close to the organizers told Reuters, declining to say who would speak while confirming representatives from both the Chinese and US governments would share the podium. But the event, yet to be formally announced by hosts US-China Business Council (USCBC) and the National Committee on US-China Relations (NCUSCR), also presents uneasy optics. According to event notifications seen by Reuters, some US firms will pay tens of thousands of dollars to hear a ""Chinese state leader"" from a government that Washington has accused of genocide against Muslim Uyghurs. China has vigorously denied the accusations. The USCBC and NCUSCR both declined to comment on the planned dinner. China's embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Xi, who is widely expected to deliver a speech, will be eager to convince US industry that China is still open for business after recording its first quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. Even as China this year cast off COVID-19 pandemic controls that effectively shut its borders, it has grown more suspicious of engagement with Western companies, in line with Xi's emphasis on national security. Xi has overseen a crackdown on US consultancy and due-diligence firms, a further blow to investor confidence. 'FILET MIGNON' AND HUMAN RIGHTS For decades, business and trade has been at the center of US-China relations, helping to fuel China's explosive economic resurgence and offering what Beijing has often described as the ballast in otherwise contentious ties. But concerns about a new style cold war between the rival economic and geopolitical superpowers has increasingly placed companies in the cross hairs of both governments. Xi is on his first visit to the US in more than six years and the pricey dinner, up to $40,000 for a table of eight, according to one notice for the event, is routine by standards for past Chinese presidential visits. Reuters was not able to obtain a list of attendees, but executives of some companies who spoke privately to Reuters said they would steer clear given questions about the utility for their operations in China and US political risks. Jeff Moon, a former US trade official turned business adviser, said China's goal would be to soften Xi's image and attract investment, but that the dinner was unlikely to ""move any needles."" US lawmakers have castigated some American businesses for turning a blind eye to allegations of forced labor in China and some have been scathing in their criticism of the event. ""How does that dinner conversation go? 'Wow, this filet mignon is a little dry. How's your extrajudicial internment of over a million Uyghur Muslims going?"" said Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representative's select committee on China. Despite human rights concerns, Biden has made a diplomatic push to improve relations, which slid to what many analysts viewed as an all-time low after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February. The Biden administration says communication at the highest level is essential to prevent competition veering into conflict, and in the interest of the global economy too. Biden's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated ahead of the APEC summit that while the US sought to reduce its dependence on China in some areas, it did not seek broad economic decoupling. The dinner is Xi's ""reassurance tour,"" and business leaders would look to him to set expectations for how foreign companies would be treated in China, said Nirav Patel, chief executive of consultancy The Asia Group. ""They have come to accept that there's no substitute for hearing and seeing and observing what Xi Jinping is doing,"" said Patel. “Of course, there are some that want to be able to demonstrate that they are committed to China and their presence in these meetings demonstrates that.” ""Exciting news!

Lubna Nazir Shaboo and her daughter Karima, crossed the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Monday evening. “They are in al-Arish (a city in Egypt). Tomorrow morning (Tuesday) they will move to Cairo,” Lubna’s husband Nedal Toman said in a text message sent to PTI from Gaza. The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region — in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo — for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. “We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,” she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their “water supply was officially cut off” in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn’t seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.",top,india,0.4841897233201581,506,16,31.625,57.046

The riots were news for a few days, but the two families are now on their own in the communally sensitive Malwa-Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh which votes to elect a new assembly on November 17. The Malwa Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh has seen a spurt in the number of communal clashes cases in the past five years (File photo) “After the death of my son, both Congress and BJP leaders assured a government job to another of my sons. We waited but nothing happened. I don’t trust anyone now,” said Khan, whose son Ibraish Khan was killed in communal violence. Ram Joshi, Shivam’s cousin brother, said, “Whether its BJP or Congress, we didn’t get any relief.” We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The sensibilities of the region can be gauged from the prevailing electoral narratives: the Israel-Hamas conflict ; the movie Kashmir Files (screened in Khargone in March); the ban on the Popular Front of India; the demolition of homes of Muslim families whose members were allegedly involved in communal riots; and the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The Malwa Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh has seen a spurt in the number of communal clashes cases in the past five years. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports for 2021 and 2020 , as many as 34 cases related to communal clashes (22 cases in 2021 and 12 cases in 2020) and 128 cases of promoting enmity between two groups (50 and 78 cases) were registered despite bandh due to Covid 19. In 2018, the corresponding numbers were 12 and 82. In 2018, the BJP won 28 of the 66 assembly constituencies in the region as compared to the 56 seats it won in 2013 (it won 41 in 2008). The Congress won 35 seats in 2018 against 9 seats in 2013 (24 in 2008).

Trees in Indore have been painted with the name of Ram. BJP national secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya is contesting against sitting Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla from Indore 1 assembly constituency, where Muslim bangle seller Taslim was beaten up for allegedly sexually harassing a minor girl in Govind Colony in 2021. Tasleem was booked under Protection Of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act and over a dozen people were booked for assaulting him. Three Muslim men who protested against the beating were booked under National Security Act (NSA). Hindu residents have put up photos of Hindu gods and goddess outside their homes to display their religious identity. In a colony of at least 150 houses, people are not comfortable talking about the incident and police said both the father of the girl, who was allegedly sexually harassed and Tasleem have withdrawn their complaints . Geeta Bhatnagar, mother of one of the accused in the case said, “My son tried to help his friend from the shakha (the branch of the Rashtryia Swayamsewak Sangh, the BJP;s idological parent) as he claimed that his daughter was harassed by Tasleem. But things turned sour after the video of people thrashing Tasleem went viral. We faced a lot of criticism. No BJP leader came to support us. Later, the matter was disposed of. Now, they want us to ask for votes from public in favour of the party.” Local BJP leader Ramesh Mohte refuted this and said the party helped the families and highlighted how their “identity was at risk” due to Muslims. “Tasleem is just one example,” he said, launching into a tirade of how the banned PFI is trying to disturb peace in the Malwa region. The Congress sees this as an attempt to polarise. The Congress candidate from Indore 1, Sanjay Shukla, the sitting MLA, said: “The BJP led-state government is pushing its agenda of targetting one community to polarise voters. They have not succeeded in their communalisation bid and has therefore, fielded a senior leader like Vijayvargiya. Still, the BJP will lose.” Polarisation is also evident in Bhavsar Mohalla, Khaskhaswadi, Anand Nagar and Sanjay Nagar in Khargone, about 150 km from Indore. In the April 2022 Khargone riots, caused by overlapping RamNavami and Ramdan celebrations in the Talab Chowk area of the town, 62 FIRs have been registered and more than 160 people arrested. Half of them are still in jail, said a police officer who asked not to be named. The riots resulted in one death and 50 injured including a superintendent of police. Indeed, some seats in the region will vote on the basis of communal issues but the “election is about the work (chief minister) Shivraj (Chouhan) has done in 18 years,” said Indor- based journalist Arvind Dubey.

24,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679

Though Schnapp could not be seen holding the stickers which read “Zionism is sexy” and “Hamas is ISIS”, he appeared to be smiling as he filmed those who were showing the stickers off. Schnapp has been vocal in his support for Israel since the conflict escalated on October 7. The footage has gone viral after being reposted on Twitter, where the divisive stickers have sparked fury among pro-Palestinian accounts who have taken umbrage at the way the stickers appeared to be paraded joyfully by Noah Schnapp‘s friends. Noah Schnapp labeled a ‘Zionist’ after viral sticker footage In a video originally posted to Instagram stories but re-uploaded to Twitter by culture hub Pop Base, a group of around five people, including what appears to be Schnapp and influencer Moti Ankari, can be seen smiling and laughing. It appears they show off the stickers to the camera. Ankari can be seen holding a “Zionism is sexy” sticker to his head and posing, while a red sticker declaring that “Hamas is ISIS” sits next to Schnapp, who is smiling and filming the group. The footage has prompted outrage on social media, with one user labeling Schnapp “disgustingly zionist” for his role in the clip.

The concept of Zionism is particularly controversial at this moment in time. The Israel-Palestine conflict derives from a deep-seated dispute over the land that 19th-century Zionists occupied when establishing a homeland for Jewish people – land that Palestinians maintain they have the rights to. HITC has reached out to representatives of Noah Schnapp for comment. EXPLORED: TikTok star Elphaba Doherty debunks death claims Schnapp said he is “afraid” to be a Jewish American just now The sticker controversy is not the first time Schnapp has been in the headlines since the conflict escalated following the Hamas attacks on October 7. In the week following the attacks, Schnapp took to Instagram to share his thoughts on the matter with his 25 million followers. “As a Jewish American, I am afraid.” Wrote Schnapp, who is best known for his role as Will Byers on Stranger Things. “Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel, who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas.” He continued. Schnapp went on to note that though he wished for peace between the two nations, the comments he had reportedly received from pro-Palestinian accounts in response to his posts on the matter had been “wrong”. In the weeks since his statement, relations between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian/pro-ceasefire campaigners online are yet to improve, with no plausible end to the conflict in sight at the time of writing.

The Liverpool Arms’ owners Carys and Robert Broadhead confirmed the news on Sunday (November 12), with Saturday having been its last day of business. In a statement, they said the decision to close the nautical-themed pub, on St George’s Road, is due to a “combination of factors beyond our control”. Robert is said to also be recovering from a heart attack which he suffered last week. A statement from The Liverpool Arms on Sunday read: “It is with a heavy heart we must announce that we closed the doors of The Liverpool Arms for the last time last night. “We would like to thank everyone that has supported us over all the years, our staff – both past and present, our friends and family, our customers old and new, and the people of Menai Bridge for welcoming us into their community for over a decade. “We have met some amazing people and will miss you all. We wish all our staff the very best of luck in their next chapters. “It has not been an easy decision to make, but due to a combination of factors beyond our control over the last few years, it has reached a point where trading is no longer viable. “Also, as you may or may not know, Bob had a heart attack last week. He is now back home and recovering. “I would like to thank everybody who supported us and messaged offering their support and help during the time he was in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and this very stressful last week. “We are devastated that our 13 years at ‘The Livvy’ has to end this way – It’s been one hell of a ride.”",top,united kingdom,0.5102639296187683,341,13,26.23076923076923,76.543

""Is killing more Palestinians, is killing more than 11,000 Palestinians going to produce the peace and security that we all want for both Palestinians and Israelis? Or is it going to push the region further into hatred and despair and hopelessness?"" Mr Safadi said on 7.30. The deputy prime minister spoke to just days after Jordan joined a summit of Arab leaders urging fan immediate ceasefire in the Middle East. ""One of the outcomes of the Arab League and Muslim summit was to entrust the Secretariat of both organisations to start preparing files to document Israeli war crimes with a view to take legal action in international courts."" ""Pushing 67 per cent of Gaza's population to 56 per cent of the area of Gaza, to an area that doesn't have basic necessities, doesn't have enough hospitals, clinics or water."" ""That means concentrating 2.3 million people in an area that cannot sustain them, which would mean more misery … more hopelessness. And that is not going to be an environment in which calls for peace will thrive. I think this is another war crime."" Hospitals in Gaza have become a flashpoint in the fighting, with the Israeli Defence Force claiming Hamas uses health facilities to hide its military operations. Yesterday it released footage it claimed was filmed in Gaza's now deserted Rantisi hospital showing weapons, a tunnel entrance and a hideout used to hold hostages. The ABC has not been able to verify the footage. Mr Safadi said the claim needed to be verified by ""an independent entity"". ""It's going to be extremely hard for anybody in this part of the world to believe the claims of an army that has brought hell on 2.3 million people,"" he said. Mr Safadi said the conflict will lead to a perpetuation of violence in the region. ""This war is not just killing innocent Palestinians and destroying their livelihoods. It's creating an environment of hate."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza after the war for Israel's security. Last week on 7.30 Netanyahu adviser Mark Regev said elements of that military presence could be similar to the West Bank. Jordan's deputy prime minister rejected the idea. As Israeli forces press deeper into Gaza on their mission to destroy Hamas, the enclave's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a focal point. ""What we've been seeing very clearly is that approaching this conflict from a pure security zone, as if the assumption is that you can just suffocate people's aspirations for freedom, and then we can move ahead with that, that doesn't work,"" he said before calling for a permanent, two-state solution. ""What we all in the Arab world are saying is that there needs to be a comprehensive, immediate move to settle this conflict once and for all … address the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, and address Israel's right to security."" He also warned that the current war could expand rapidly due to tensions in the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. ""The West Bank is boiling as a result of Israeli operational measures there … you have other fronts, particularly the Lebanese-Israeli border, we're seeing tension rising there. I think unless this war stops, we're looking at the very real threat of this war expanding and dragging this whole region into the abyss of this ugly conflict."" Do you know more about this story?

Around 4,000 people have been forced from their homes in the town of Grindavik due to its proximity to the Fagradalsfjall volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula, while the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction has been closed. For many locals, the episode has revived the trauma of the disastrous explosion at another of Iceland's volcanoes, Eyjafjallajokull, back in 2010. While the eruption didn't kill anyone, it did produce a huge cloud of ash that prompted the biggest global aviation shutdown since World War II . Now, scientists have revealed to MailOnline just how big an eruption could be and if it could rival Eyjafjallajokull, which saw 50,000 flights cancelled and 8million passengers affected.

'A potential future eruption arising from the current unrest will not lead to disruption like that of the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption,' he said. 'Eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula are dominated by basalt lava production with only minor ash production, whereas the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption was dominated by ash production. 'So it is extremely unlikely that an eruption arising from the current unrest will cause disruption to transatlantic air travel.' Although Iceland's capital Reykjavik is well outside the danger zone, Iceland's airport of Keflavík lies around 10 miles (17 km) northwest of the area of unrest. At the moment, flights are departing and arriving at Keflavik – Iceland's primary international airport – as usual. However, as a precaution for domestic and international air travel, the volcanic aviation colour code for the Reykjanes Peninsula is now orange (heightened unrest). The orange alert represents the third-highest level, although it poses limited hazards to aviation. The next stage is red, reserved for an imminent or ongoing volcanic eruption that could seriously affect aviation, but this is unlikely.

The mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava. MAR forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> Advertisement Iceland is a particular hotspot for seismic activity because it sits on a tectonic plate boundary called the Mid Atlantic Ridge. The Mid Atlantic Ridge is a long chain of mountains that stretches down the Atlantic ocean, meaning most of these mountains are underground. It's gradually pushing North America and Eurasia away from each other . There are only a few places on Earth where the Mid Atlantic Ridge is exposed on land, but Iceland – which is slap bang in the middle of the ridge – is one of them. But Iceland is also located over a mantle plume – a column of hot, molten rock that rises from the deep mantle to the surface, becoming lava when it erupts. In the past week, Grindavik has become lined with massive cracks in the land that are billowing out steam – the result of magma moving underground that pushes up on the Earth's crust. Authorities are fearing eruptions of basalt lava – viscous molten rock – that comes to the surface in the region through the cracks right underneath buildings. Dr Carmen Solana, a volcanologist at the University of Portsmouth, said magma is very close to the surface' – around 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 miles) – and an eruption could occur 'at any time'. Large cracks appear on a road amid volcanic activity near Grindavik in Iceland.

Residents have been evacuated because of the concern that cracks could 'open literally underneath houses', she said, leading to 'complete destruction' of Grindavik which is a key part of the country's fishing industry. Dr Solana agreed that an imminent eruption would not cause similar travel disruption like that of the 2010 eruption. 'Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 was actually a small eruption but it happened on a volcano underneath an ice cap,' she said. 'The interaction of magma with ice, increased the explosivity, broke the magma into very small pieces of ash that went into the atmosphere. 'This is not the scenario that we're looking at here.' Despite the build-up of activity, Dr Solana added that an eruption might not actually happen. 'At the moment we don't even know if there's going to be an eruption,' she told MailOnline. 'How much magma is going to come, we don't really know. 'There might be an accumulation of magma beneath the surface but that doesn't mean that all of that is going to come to the surface.' Professor Marc K. Reichow, a geochemistat the, University of Leicester, said it's 'difficult to say' what the potential size or scale of an eruption will be. Tourists walk on recently cooled lava from the Fagradalsfjall Volcano in southwestern Iceland back in 2021 (file photo) 'Depending whether this eruption will take place the proximity to local residences could be dangerous and cause damage to buildings,' he said. 'The area has been evacuated and hazard to life is currently minimal.' Almannavarnir, part of Iceland's Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, has a dedicated advice page that details Grindavík's evacuation plan. Residents should close windows, unplug electrical appliances and secure the home before putting a sign outside to show the house is vacated. It says: 'Residents must evacuate their homes and leave town. This is not an emergency evacuation. It is our request to the residents of Grindavík to leave the town without any trouble. 'There is no immediate danger imminent, the evacuation is primarily preventive with the safety of all Grindvíkin in the first place.' How a volcanic eruption in 2010 sparked almost a month of chaos for European air travel A volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2010 sparked the worst air travel disruption since the Second World War. Chaos descended within the European travel industry when an unfortunate series of phenomenons combined from a number of relatively small volcanic events at Eyjafjallajokull, on the south side of the island. Seismic activity had started at the end of 2009 and had intensified up until March 20, when the volcano - which is covered by an ice cap - finally erupted. The eruption was small - just one out of seven on the scale used to measure eruptions. Globally, it appeared a relatively small event at the time. But around five days later, scientists began to notice unusual activity. They found evidence at magma was flowing from underneath the crust into Eyjafjallajokull's magma chamber and that pressure stemming from the process caused a huge crustal displacement. While the eruption began as an effusive eruption - where lava runs from the volcano along the ground - the volcano then entered an explosive stage on April 14. This time, the explosion was measured as a four on the volcanic scale Meanwhile, ice surrounding the volcano started melting and began flooding into the volcano. This rapid cooling caused the magma to shear into fine and jagged ash particles. It also increased the volcano's explosive power. While the eruption began as an effusive eruption - where lava runs from the volcano along the ground - the volcano then entered an explosive stage on April 14. This time, the explosion was measured as a four on the volcanic scale. A huge ash cloud was fired into the air, reaching up to nine kilometres in height. Around 250 million cubic metres of volcanic material was also spewed into the air as a result of the explosion. To make matters worse, the volcano was directly under a jet stream and the rapid cooling from the ice water gave the volcano enough power to shoot the ash directly into it. The jet stream was also unusually stable at the time and sent ash particles from the volcano continuously southeast - towards Europe. From April 14-20, ash from the volcanic eruption covered large areas of Northern Europe. About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial jet traffic and it affected approximately 10 million travellers, with nearly 100,000 flights to and from and within Europe cancelled across the six day period. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) estimated that airports lost £80 million over the six-and-a-half days, while the knock-on disruption lasted for around a month. In the United Kingdom alone thirteen travel firms collapsed during the summer of 2010. The ash cloud disruption was cited as one of the contributing factors. A huge ash cloud was fired into the air, reaching up to nine kilometres in height. Around 250 million cubic metres of volcanic material was also spewed into the air as a result of the explosion Several sports matches were postponed, while Liverpool football club had to travel by coach to Madrid in order to play a match in the Europa League. While the travel disruption mostly ran throughout April, volcanic activity continued at Eyjafjallajokull until October, when scientists declared the eruption was over. In 2011, a volcano under the Vatnajökull glacier sent thousands of tonnes of ash into the sky in a few days, raising concerns of a repeat of the travel chaos seen across northern Europe. Though the explosion was larger than Eyjafjallajokull, the impact was not as wide-spread. A total of 900 flights (out of 90,000 in Europe) were cancelled as a result of the eruption in the period May 23-25. In 2014, Bárðarbunga erupted in what was the biggest eruption in Iceland in more than 200 years. However, only local travel was impacted as a result.

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

33,10:03:46,Pakistan: 2 soldiers killed in gun battle with terrorists in north Waziristan,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/pakistan-2-soldiers-killed-in-gun-battle-with-terrorists-in-north-waziristan-23319820,"Two soldiers lost their lives in an armed confrontation between security forces and terrorists in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan district in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats. ADVERTISEMENT This incident follows a recent terrorist attack on police personnel in Tank, where three officers, including an SHO, were killed, and several others were injured. The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed numerous fatalities and injuries, primarily concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, accounting for the majority of attacks and counter-terror operations during this period. Recently, at least nine people, including five children, of the same family were killed when a rocket launcher's shell exploded at a house while the kids were playing with the ammunition in 's Sindh province, police said. Nine individuals were killed when a rocket shell they found while playing on the ground burst at home, according to Kashmore-Kandhkot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Rohil Khosa. The victims included five children, two women, and two adults from the same household, stated a report in agencies. In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital. ""This is an area on the riverine belt and the rocket shell must have been left there by dacoits who hide out deep into the riverine belt areas,"" Khoso stated. According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status. Former foreign minister and chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari tweeted that several criminal gangs have found refuge in the riverine areas of Sindh and Punjab and urged the government to rid the area of such individuals.",world,india,0.5236139630390144,487,18,27.055555555555557,41.92
34,09:31:53,Palestinian children in the West Bank are also under attack,https://turks.us/palestinian-children-in-the-west-bank-are-also-under-attack/,"While the world’s focus is on Israel’s genocidal siege and bombing campaign in Gaza, Israel is also inflicting terror on Palestinians across the occupied West Bank. At least 186 people, including more than 30 children, have been killed there by the Israeli military and settlers since October 7. And nowhere in the occupied territories has seen more military aggression than the Jenin refugee camp, which to all intents and purposes has become a warzone. Since 2018, the Brighton Trust, an English charity that I am part of, has been helping fund the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre in the camp. It is a place where children can go to learn, play and socialise. In recent weeks, many have sought refuge from Israeli bombing in the Centre, and have been sleeping there because their homes have been destroyed. Like every corner of the overpopulated camp, the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre is currently under attack. In fact, it has been under attack for a long time. In July this year, during their violent incursion into Jenin which killed 12 Palestinians, Israeli soldiers also raided the Centre and wrecked it. They not only destroyed all facilities and equipment, including children’s books, but also punched large holes into the exterior walls of the building, leaving it barely habitable. Our charity, together with the British Shalom-Salaam Trust, had to raise money to repair the building and replace equipment. Children eventually returned to the Centre, but it was clear that they were not safe there. The Israeli military was determined not to allow Palestinians in Jenin to have peace and quiet, even at a centre for children. And things got significantly worse since Israel responded to Hamas’s October 7 attack with a genocidal bombing campaign in Gaza and increasingly aggressive and deadly military operations across the West Bank. A teacher at the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre wrote to me in mid-October about the horrific situation Jenin’s children have been in since the July incursion. “We did not have one peaceful night since [July],” she explained. “When the attacks on the Gaza Strip started, the attacks on the camp became even worse. Life got so hard that it feels like we can’t breathe. The soldiers are threatening that they will do the same to us in Jenin, as they are doing to people in Gaza. Actually, they have already started doing it, but the world is too busy elsewhere, showing only the Israeli side of the story. We have only one wish today. To have just one peaceful night, without waking up with the news that a family member or an entire family got killed.” She went on to tell me about the night soldiers entered her home and detained her family for hours as they tried to capture someone in the area. “They locked us up for three hours in the bathroom,” she said. “Even my brother’s baby, who is only 15 days old, was not allowed to get milk. These things start to feel normal here, but all the children are dying from inside. They don’t understand why this is happening. We are screaming, but no one hears us.” The same teacher wrote to me once again on October 27. “Each night we lose people, children. We buried lots, but because they die after the attack, the news never mentions them! Even our cemetery was bombed.” “Our Centre is in the middle of camp, the only lovely place for children. It is now very dangerous to reach, but the children find it the only place that can help them survive. I can’t tell them we are really in danger [at the centre]!” The media only talks about the Gaza Strip. But in the West Bank, the situation is very bad as well. Cities, villages and camps are all locked down and under near-constant attack. And everyone, including thousands of children, is at risk and suffering. Israel’s excuse for its murder and maiming of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in the Gaza Strip is that it is trying to “destroy Hamas”. In the West Bank, Hamas is not in power, yet Israel is increasing the repression and the violence. It is doing so because its real objective, in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, is not “destroying Hamas” or defeating any other enemy. Its true goal is, and has always been, ethnic cleansing. As we’ve already seen in a leaked Ministry of Intelligence document, Israel desires to annex the whole of Gaza and expel its population into the Sinai desert. The same is true in the West Bank even if, so far, the means of expelling the Indigenous population are not the same. Large areas of the West Bank had already been made Arabrein (“free of Arabs”) through the use of settler and army terror and pogroms before October 7. But in the last month, there has been an acceleration in Palestinians being forced out of their villages and homes. On October 28, the Palestinian community of in the South Hebron Hills had to pack up and leave their lands due to settler terror. This was just one of the eight communities that have been forced to abandon their homes and lands in the past four weeks. Six others have been partially evacuated after villagers have been told they will be killed if they refuse to leave. This is a pattern we have seen before. First, Palestinians in rural areas will be forced to leave their land and move into cities. Then, those in the cities will be pushed out into a third country. Israel has embarked on a second Nakba – not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. On November 9, there was yet another attack on Jenin, the most serious yet. 14 Palestinians were murdered, mostly by drones. During the attack, Al Tafawk Centre was tear gassed with the children still inside it and, according to some reports we received, live ammunition was used. Most of the children were evacuated, but about 20, owing to the inhalation of gas, were unable to. Later the same day, the teacher I’ve been in contact with risked her own life and went into the Centre to check up on the children. She found some of the children unconscious. It beggars belief how a children’s centre has become the object of a military attack unless the real goal is to destroy all Palestinian civil society organisations. On November 13, we received a distressing message from the Centre’s head teacher whose father has been arrested and beaten. She told us the Centre is barely operating because of the attacks of the Israeli army. People have no food, and many of the children don’t know what has happened to their families. The Al Tafawk Children’s Centre, and the Palestinian children trying to find peace and safety there, are now under attack. Like others in the Jenin camp, across the occupied West Bank, and in Gaza, they are being targeted, threatened and traumatised for the crime of being Palestinian, and trying to exist in their ancestral lands. They are telling us that “they cannot breathe”. That they are screaming, but no one is listening. The world cannot continue to ignore their plight. We have to help the children of Gaza, and the West Bank. We have to demand an immediate end to Israel’s brutal ethnic cleansing campaign.",world,turkey,0.34898388227049754,1427,71,20.098591549295776,73.897

At least 179 people, including babies and patients who died in the intensive care unit, were buried in a ""mass grave"" at Gaza's biggest hospital. Seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those buried after hospital fuel supplies ran out at the compound. Israel accused Hamas of using hospitals as hideouts. Hamas has denied the claim. US president Joe Biden urged Israel to protect Gaza's main hospital saying, “It's my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital. The hospital must be protected.” Israel's army cited a discarded baby bottle, makeshift toilet and motorbike as evidence that Hamas held hostages in a Gaza hospital. Israel army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli army confirmed the death of Noa Marciano, a woman soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas. ""Exciting news!

36,13:07:49,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced this on Tuesday, November 14, in a speech at the 1st BARMM Local Legislative General Assembly in Davao City. He said the Philippines and Japan signed the diplomatic notes on the non-project grant aid (NPGA) for the acquisition of construction equipment. The equipment would be used for road network improvement and disaster quick response operation in the Bangsamoro region. Marcos said this was signed during the Philippine visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida earlier in November. Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo and Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Koshikawa Kazuhiko signed the diplomatic notes on a non-project grant aid (NPGA) valued at some $6.8 million. Officials said the initiative seeks to support relief efforts during calamities, including restoring roads and bridges, while also addressing the impact of climate-related flooding in the area. The NPGA, a form of grant, is intended to assist developing nations by providing foreign currency funding for importing Japanese technology-oriented goods to address specific social or economic needs. Marcos told BARMM officials that his administration has continued to seek international support especially from predominantly Muslim countries, for the Bangsamoro region. “﻿We have continued in our contacts around – in the trips that I have taken for the government, especially when we are talking to the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation), when we are talking to Malaysia, when we are talking to other Islamic countries, we continue to remind them that BARMM still needs their support. And I have to say to their credit that they have pledged that support and we will continue to support BARMM and that is an important part of the success that BARMM is going to have,” he said. Marcos said the initiatives would usher in a new era “where BARMM becomes a shining beacon of sustainable development in Mindanao and the rest of the Philippines.” Greater cooperation Marcos also expressed confidence about the prospect of enhanced cooperation, coordination, and convergence of endeavors in the region. He said seven offices and mechanisms were now in place under the Inter-governmental Relations Body (IGRB) to strengthen and build on the synergy between the national and Bangsamoro governments as the region’s officials formulate policies, rules, and enforce regional laws. The mechanisms are the following: Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum Intergovernmental Fiscal Policy Board Joint Body for the Zones of Joint Cooperation Intergovernmental Infrastructure Development Board Intergovernmental Energy Board Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board Council of Leaders ﻿”The national and Bangsamoro governments will now have greater cooperation because of these offices that have now been established. We will have greater cooperation, greater coordination, and we will converge towards the realization of our shared endeavors,” Marcos Jr. said. – Rappler.com",top,philippines,0.48114901256732495,557,18,30.944444444444443,29.479

41,10:33:50,Ask Amy: The bride and I aren’t speaking because of her non-negotiable demand,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2023/11/14/ask-amy-dickinson-the-bride-and-i-arent-speaking/,": My daughter will be getting married in a couple of weeks (her second marriage). Related Articles They were engaged right before COVID and put the wedding on hold. They’ve now decided to go ahead with a small wedding; the guest list is now around 26 people. She wanted to host it in her house, but her house is very small and she has four dogs who don’t behave. We offered our (much larger) house and said that we would also help with the food and set-up. Our daughter agreed on one condition – that she bring her dogs. She wants to dress them up and have them be a part of her wedding. Her dogs are not well-behaved. They are not consistently housebroken. They bark a lot and jump on people. These dogs have never been to our house. We have hardwood floors and new furniture. Who is going to be responsible for them? My daughter said it’s non-negotiable, so she will have it at her place. Her house is small. Parking and seating will be problems. Also, my husband has lung disease, and so being in a small house with 26 people and all the dog hair and dander is unacceptable to us. My husband said he won’t be going, but hasn’t told her yet. We said we’d pay for a reception hall, but that is also unacceptable to our daughter. Are we wrong in not allowing the dogs at our house for the wedding? Is she wrong for wanting the wedding at her house even though it’s small and wouldn’t be good for her father? I’m heartbroken over this, and my daughter and I are not speaking. Don’t get me wrong – we love dogs. But how would this be enjoyable for anyone? : You and your daughter are at an impasse, but if you can choose to calmly accept her choices – however harebrained you believe them to be – then it will release both of you. Neither one of you is “wrong.” The significant difference between you two is … it’s her wedding. She has named her dogs as her most beloved attendants. You’ve drawn the line about having the dogs in your house (smart move) and offered a number of options she deems unacceptable, and so her decision has been made. If it would endanger your husband’s health to attend this wedding, then he should stay home. If you can bear spending a couple of hours in her home under these circumstances, you should try your best to attend, and see if you can FaceTime or set up a Zoom session for your husband to view the ceremony. This whole thing sounds like your nightmare. (It is certainly mine.) But it is her wedding, and if you consciously decide to stop judging and undermining her choices, you should spare yourself both the heartbreak and the tension. Everything after that is up to her. : I know some people who occasionally come out with, “All I can do is be honest” when asked about something. You already know that really means, “Brace yourself. Here comes a negative observation encased in a pejorative comment.” When someone says that, I have taken to saying, “Oh. You’re one of those lucky ones. A whole bunch of us got sucked into believing it is more important to be polite and considerate of other people’s feelings.” Do you think my response is rude and condescending? It almost always embarrasses the other person who made the honesty comment. Please be honest with me (pun intended). : Yes, I do think your response is at the very least sarcastic, and definitely condescending. Related Articles I do understand your impulse to head comments off at the pass, however, especially if you assume they will be negative or upsetting. But you should consider whether it might be better for you to let people reveal themselves through their own words, and then you can respond with your own brand of honesty. Thank you for your who drinks to excess every day and yet claims that his drinking does not harm anyone, including himself. Wow – I had a parent like that! After a childhood of neglect, my siblings and I got to watch him die an excruciating and slow death from cirrhosis of the liver. We weren’t so “happy.” : Several survivors of “happy drunks” have shared similar stories.",business,united states of america,0.4262295081967213,854,53,16.11320754716981,83.752
42,11:46:00,Rise in AI Art in Digital Realm and the Drastic Fall of NFTs,https://themarketperiodical.com/2023/11/14/rise-in-ai-art-in-digital-realm-and-the-drastic-fall-of-nfts/,"AI (artificial intelligence) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) were both looked upon as futuristic technologies with path-breaking possibilities for shaping our future. Both of these technologies were also supposed to complement and enhance each other with time; however, we are witnessing the reverse of that. With the rise of AI art in the digital realm, NFTs might be facing a bit of a setback. NFTs were surely the talk of the town in the recent past. They came across as a revolutionary wave for monetizing digital art and authenticating it. This opened a completely new sector, an entirely new industry or an avenue in itself but the landscape has transformed quite dramatically now. The advent of AI and its revolutionary outbreak has stimulated some unprecedented repercussions for the NFT market. NFT prices, which should have surged up, have dropped as things went south. There has been a prominent drop since 2022, the phase when the AI digital realm escalated to new heights. This has raised the question of sustainability and there have been raised eyebrows over the long-term impact of NFTs. NFTs saw a sudden spike in 2021 and sky-rocketed to become one of the most lucrative domains. NFTs were an enticing entity. However, the market decline was soon anticipated after the sudden spike when NFT prices depreciated by 80%. The rise of AI art seemed to happen parallel to the vulnerable fortunes of NFTs. AI art basically leverages artificial intelligence to create and design digital art pieces and collectibles. Just like NFTs, it managed to democratize the art-making process but on hindsight, it also provoked our conventional understanding of creativity and originality. There have been various factors, apart from AI, that have been responsible for the NFT’s downfall. The cybersecurity issue has raised severe concern for many investors. There have been instances of million-dollar NFTs being stolen. Crypto volatility has an effect on NFTs. There has also been a lack of regulatory framework, which have contributed to the vulnerability NFT transactions are conducted on Ethereum; therefore, any fluctuations in Ethereum deeply impact the NFT market. Just like the case with the 2008 economic crisis, where speculation and overvaluation of real estate assets led to an economic downfall, there is a period of intense hype and overvaluation regarding the NFT market. Many people who tend to make impulse purchases face unprecedented repercussions. The technological landscape is ever-changing and dynamic; this rise of AI and the NFT’s downfall might be part of a larger narrative. The intersection of AI art and NFTs has given rise to new possibilities and made people more curious about art, creativity, and value in the digital age. AI art has flooded the digital landscape with numerous art-stimulating oversaturations for the NFT market.",top,united kingdom,0.4827586206896552,522,26,20.076923076923077,54.232

Discussions are expected to address issues such as automobiles, medical devices, and the movement of professionals. The negotiating team is likely to visit India for the 14th round of negotiations to expedite the talks. While virtual sessions are ongoing, both sides are planning for a comprehensive round of talks where all chapters will be discussed simultaneously. Key issues that require resolution include rules of origin, intellectual property rights (IPRs), social security agreements, duty concessions on electric vehicles, scotch whiskey, lamb meat, chocolates, and certain confectionary items, as well as liberalization of norms in the services sector, including banking and insurance. ADVERTISEMENT Progress is also being made on the proposed bilateral investment treaty (BIT), negotiated separately between India and the UK. BITs play a crucial role in promoting and protecting investments in each other's countries. One of the main points of contention is the mechanism for dispute settlement, with India proposing to exhaust local judicial remedies before resorting to international arbitration. India and the UK initiated talks for the free trade agreement in January 2022, with a goal to conclude discussions by Diwali in October 2022. However, the deadline was missed due to political developments in the UK. The agreement comprises 26 chapters covering goods, services, investments, and intellectual property rights. Indian industries are advocating for greater access for skilled professionals, particularly in IT and healthcare, in the UK market, along with market access for various goods at nil customs duties. The UK, on the other hand, is seeking significant reductions in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, automobiles, lamb meat, chocolates, and certain confectionary items. Bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23 from USD 17.5 billion in 2021-22. The 'rules of origin' provision aims to prevent the dumping of goods by prescribing minimal processing in the FTA country. This ensures that the final manufactured product can be considered originating goods in that country.",top,india,0.5137844611528822,399,16,24.9375,39.759
44,09:17:34,Lorraine Kelly says witnessing horrific Lockerbie bombing was like being in a ‘warzone’,https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/14/lorraine-kelly-hits-back-revealing-lockerbie-tragedy-caused-ptsd-19808644/,"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lorraine Kelly has recalled witnessing the horror of the Lockerbie bombing, and opened up about suffering from PTSD, which she didn’t feel entitled to. Back in December 1988, Lorraine was one of the first journalists to arrive on the scene of the terror attack , in which Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the small Scottish town mid-air, killing 270 people. Before the police cordoned off the area, the presenter, now 63, saw first-hand the shocking aftermath of the disaster. She’s now returned to the scene for a new documentary, Return To Lockerbie With Lorraine Kelly, in which she admits to still struggling with what she witnessed. Appearing on Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, Lorraine recalled how the scene was like ‘a warzone’, and how surreal it was to witness. She told Susanna Reid and Ed Balls: ‘A lot of people have forgotten it was the worst terrorist atrocity in Europe.’ Lorraine went on to say that the reason she wanted to go back for the documentary stemmed from wanting to see how people have recovered from the horrific tragedy. ‘It was surreal, like a warzone,’ she recalled. ‘I remember driving down and we had to stop the car because of shrapnel,’ Lorraine went on, explaining that their car was punctured by debris, forcing them to stop. ‘Very quickly, you realise this was huge, this was enormous.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Talking about suffering from PTSD in the aftermath of her reporting, Lorraine continued: ‘Utterly surreal and horrific, and I have erased a lot of it because you can’t live with those images. ‘I was only reporting on it, I wasn’t caught up in it, I wasn’t some of the very young members of the rescue service that had to go out and retreat bodies.’ She added: ‘They were absolutely distraught.’ Lorraine said that people didn’t reach out for mental health help at the time, and while she still suffers from those horrific memories at the smell of aviation fuel , she doesn’t feel as though she’s entitled to suffering from PTSD. She said: ‘I don’t feel I was traumatised in that sense, in any way, I was only reporting on it I was just bearing witness to it, but something like that does stay with you.’ ‘I was told by an expert that I probably suffered from [PTSD], I don’t think I’m entitled to that because I was only witnessing it.’ Ahead of the documentary airing, Lorraine has spoken about how many people ‘didn’t appreciate the scale of what happened and the effect it had on people here’. In an interview, she also admitted it took her a long time to acknowledge that she was suffering from PTSD. ‘I was just doing my job. Nobody I loved was murdered – and they were murdered as far as I am concerned,’ she said of the attack, which saw Libyan Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi convicted in 2001 of planting the bomb on the plane. ‘For years, I always said, “I do not have the right to this, to have these feelings”. ‘PTSD is not me, that’s for all the people who went through losing people or were living there at the time. Or had been a soldier in a war zone,’ she added while speaking to The Telegraph . Lorraine Kelly devastated after death of ITV producer, 33 Strictly's Krishnan Guru-Murthy ordered to show off dramatic weight loss Joe Tracini still 'waiting for the old me' to turn up amid mental health battle She continued: ‘I work with Help for Heroes and so many people in the forces say, ‘I’m fine, I’m fine’, and they are not fine. But I am fine. I was only reporting on it. That’s not to say I wasn’t very badly affected.’ However, after someone made a comment online about her honest admission , Lorraine hit back. ‘Well, just think of what it did to the people were actually working on the recovery and collection of humans remains. Think about the destruction in Lockerbie. PTSD really!?,’ the X, formerly Twitter, user wrote on the social media site. Lorraine responded: ‘That’s exactly the point. I always (and still do) feel I’ve no right to have suffered any sort of trauma compared with the bereaved, the first responders and the people of Lockerbie. ‘I was only a reporter. But in the doco I learned PTSD is a normal response. I’m fine. I’m lucky,’ she added. In the documentary Lorraine speaks to Drew Young, one of a team of people asked to guard the nosecone of the plane that had fallen in a field next to Tundergarth Church, about the effect on the residents and first responders. ‘A lot of folk wouldn’t talk about it… It’s like a shutter coming down. You know, you got on with it,’ he recalled. Recalling her own traumatic memories, she said: ‘It was horrendous, eerie, really quiet, with lots of weird smells. But it is the aviation fuel that I remember most.’ Next month will mark 35 years since the then 29-year-old Lorraine arrived at the scene, which she also told the publication looked like ‘the set of a disaster movie’. ‘The exhausted rescue services searched in vain for people to save. All they could do that night, and in the days to come, was locate and recover the bodies of all of the dead,’ she shared. ‘Looking back, as we trudged through that field, I realise I was only able to function and do my job because it felt so utterly unreal. It was like the set of a disaster movie.’ While she didn’t seek counselling at the time, Lorraine said her own form of ‘therapy’ involved speaking to her father about what she saw. The presenter has said one of the main reasons she made the documentary was to highlight the issue of PTSD and encourage people suffering to get help. It has been reported that 73 per cent of people living in Lockerbie at the time of the disaster now suffer from PTSD.

This was a more than three-fold increase compared to the whole of 2022, when 436 anti-Semitic acts or remarks were recorded. ""These are mainly tags and insults, but there are also assaults and injuries"", Darmanin added. Those acts resulted in 571 arrests, the ministry told AFP. In late October, Paris prosecutors opened an investigation into an incident when dozens of Stars of David were daubed on buildings around the city and its suburbs. France has accused Russia of interfering in its affairs by sharing photos online of the anti-Semitic graffiti. Darmanin said there had also been anti-Muslim incidents ""but they are not on the scale of what we are seeing in terms of anti-Semitism"". He said that some mosques had received threats of violence.

""To take off an exhibition is something that usually is not done because we trust the building, we trust the safety of the showcases. But this is a different situation so we have to act accordingly,"" said Hagit Maoz, curator of the Shrine of the Book at Jerusalem's Israel Museum. The iconic building, shaped like the lids of the jars in which the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, is usually packed with visitors eager to glimpse the collection of ancient religious texts. Today the eight display cases lining the walls have paper notes saying ""temporarily removed"".

The Hamas attack over a month ago sparked the war in Gaza, where Israel has since carried out a devastating bombardment and ground offensive. Thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel. Nurith Goshen, curator of Chalcolithic and Bronze Age archaeology, was cleaning up broken glass from a rocket strike near her home outside Jerusalem on Oct. 7 when the museum called announcing the war protocol and asking to confirm her list. ""You really have to choose the finest or the most fragile artefacts,"" she said. Her list included items on loan from the Louvre and the British Museum, and she said they got permission from those museums before taking them down. ""You really understand the meaning of what we are holding here, and what we have under our custodianship for Israel, but also for the world,"" said Goshen. The Tel Aviv Museum of Art took similar precautions. Gustav Kimt's Portrait of Friedericke Maria Beer, painted two years before his death, is now stored on a rack in a fortified underground bunker with other works. The paintings left behind blank spaces on the gallery's wall. ""These works of art have experienced war, some of them survived World War Two,"" said museum director Tania Coen-Uzzielli. ""We are custodians for a short time, and we needed to protect them. To protect them for posterity and for history."" ""Exciting news!

48,10:00:59,"Star Bulk Carriers Corp. Reports Net Profit of $43.7 Million for the Third Quarter of 2023, and Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.22 Per Share",https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/star-bulk-carriers-corp-reports-net-profit-of-43-7-million-for-the-third-quarter-of-2023-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-of-0-22-per-share/,"Star Bulk Carriers Corp, a global shipping company focusing on the transportation of dry bulk cargoes, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2023. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this press release to “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar references, mean Star Bulk Carriers Corp. and, where applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Petros Pappas, Chief Executive Officer of Star Bulk, commented: “During the third quarter, Star Bulk reported Net Income of $43.7 million and TCE of $15,068 / day per vessel, exceeding the fleet-weighted average Baltic indices by 28.6%. Coverage for Q4 is at ~65% of our available days at a TCE of ~$17,200 / day per vessel. Our Board of Directors has approved a dividend distribution of $0.22 / share, consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. The agreements to repurchase in aggregate 20 million Company shares from Oaktree at an average price of $19 per share represent an important milestone for Star Bulk. We believe we have utilized a variety of tools to create value and we expect these transactions to be accretive to NAV per share, EPS and DPS: We were able to repurchase a large block of shares at a significant discount to our Net Asset Value. We have funded the above repurchase mostly from vessel sales at attractive historical prices during 2023. Recently we sold shares through our ATM program at an average price of $19.81/share, locking in a favorable arbitrage. We have decided to take further steps towards our fleet renewal, having designed with the selected shipyard and subsequently ordering 2 latest generation Eco Kamsarmax vessels with the option to order two additional vessels. The vessels are to be built in China to a high specification, fitted with the latest fuel-efficient engine coming into production in 2024, a shaft generator as well as Alternate Marine Power provisions reducing vessels’ energy requirements. The above will help to ensure best-in-class fuel consumptions and emissions. On the sales front, we continue to dispose of vessels opportunistically, having agreed to sell five vessels, reducing our average fleet age and improving overall fleet efficiency. We remain optimistic about the prospects of the dry bulk market due to increasingly favorable supply dynamics, the improving macro sentiment and large global infrastructure investment needs for the world’s green transition. We intend to remain focused on actively managing our scrubber fitted and diverse fleet to take advantage of market opportunities and continue creating value for our shareholders.” Recent Developments Declaration of Dividend On November 13, 2023, pursuant to our dividend policy, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on or about December 18, 2023 to all shareholders of record as of December 5, 2023. The ex-dividend date is expected to be December 4, 2023. At-The-Market Offering Program, Share Repurchase Program & Shares Outstanding Update During October 2023, we issued and sold 678,282 common shares under our effective at-the-market offering programs at an average price of $19.81 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $13.43 million. On September 21, 2023 and on October 30, 2023 we agreed to repurchase 10 million of our common shares at a price of $18.50 per common share (the “First Oaktree Share Repurchase”) and 10 million of our common shares at a price of $19.50 per common share (the “Second Oaktree Share Repurchase”), respectively, from affiliates of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”). The First Oaktree Share Repurchase was completed in early October, with the repurchased shares being withdrawn and cancelled. Closing of the Second Oaktree Share Repurchase is expected to occur on December 1, 2023 after which the 10 million repurchased shares will be withdrawn and cancelled. As of the date of this release, we have 93,861,792 shares outstanding or 83,861,792 as adjusted for the closing of the Second Oaktree Share Repurchase and the expected cancellation of the repurchased common shares. Fleet Update In September 2023, we agreed to sell the vessel Star Zeta, which was delivered to her new owner in October 2023. In addition, in October and November 2023 we agreed to sell the vessels Star Athena, Star Glory, Star Theta and Star Jennifer. The vessels are expected to be delivered to their new owners in November and December 2023. The total gross proceeds from the sale of the above five vessels will be $72.5 million with a corresponding gain of $15.6 million expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. Lastly, as we look towards fleet renewal, in October 2023 we entered into two firm and two optional (exercisable until December 13, 2023) shipbuilding contracts with Qingdao Shipyard Co., Ltd. for the construction of four 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax newbuilding vessels. The expected delivery dates for the two firm shipbuilding contracts are November 2025 and June 2026 respectively, whereas delivery dates for the two optional shipbuilding contracts are December 2025 and August 2026, respectively. The newbuild vessels meet the latest requirements of Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI Phase 3) in relation to carbon intensity (CO2) and comply with the latest NOX regulations, NOX TIER III. In addition, these vessels are fitted with the latest available and most fuel efficient main engine produced by MAN B&W delivering from 2024 along with a shaft generator and Alternate Marine Power optionality, all of which help to ensure best-in-class daily fuel consumptions and emissions reduction. We have also the option to equip the vessels with Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (“EGCS” or “scrubbers”) before delivery. Financing In September 2023, we entered into a syndicated loan facility with E.SUN commercial Bank Ltd. as Agent for an amount of $140.0 million (the “ESUN $140.0 million Facility”). The ESUN $140.0 million Facility was drawn in October 2023 and is repayable in 28 equal consecutive quarterly installments of $3.8 million and a balloon payment of $32.9 million due in October 2030, along with the last installment. The loan is secured by first priority mortgages on the vessels Mackenzie, Kennadi, Honey Badger, Wolverine, Star Antares, Gargantua, Goliath and Maharaj, the lease financing of which had been prepaid in September 2023. In October 2023, we entered into a committed termsheet with CTBC Bank Co., Ltd. for a loan facility of up to $50.0 million (the “CTBC $50.0 million Facility”). The facility will be used to refinance the outstanding amounts under other loan agreements and is expected to be drawn by the end of November 2023. The CTBC $50.0 million Facility is expected to be drawn in two tranches and will mature 5 years after the drawdown. In November 2023, we entered into a committed termsheet with ING Bank N.V., London Branch for a senior secured bridge loan facility of $125.0 million (the “ING $125.0 million Bridge Facility”). The facility will be used to fund part of the consideration for the Second Oaktree Share Repurchase, as described above. The ING $125.0 million Bridge Facility is expected to be drawn in December 2023 and will mature one year after the drawdown. As of the date of this press release we are in final stage of negotiations with National Bank of Greece S.A. for a loan facility of up to $156.4 million (the “NBG $156.4 million Facility”). The purpose of the facility is to refinance the outstanding amount under the existing $125.0 million loan agreement with NBG and to provide us with additional liquidity of $70.0 million which we expect to use to finance part of the consideration for the Second Oaktree Share Repurchase. The NBG $156.4 million Facility is expected to be drawn by December 31, 2023 and will mature three years after the drawdown. In addition, following a number of interest rate swaps we have entered into, we have an outstanding total notional amount of $331.3 million under our financing agreements with an average fixed rate of 42 bps and an average maturity of 1.0 year. As of September 30, 2023 the Mark-to-Market value of our outstanding interest rate swaps stood at $15.6 million which are all designated as and qualify for hedge accounting. Change in the Board of Directors Pursuant to the previously announced First Oaktree Share Repurchase and the resulting reduction of Oaktree’s shareholding percentage in the Company, Oaktree has caused one of its designee directors, Mr. Ryan Lee, to resign from our Board of Directors. Mr. Lee served on our Board since August 30, 2023 as a Class B director and was a member of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee. The size of the Board is reduced to 10 members. Vessel Employment Overview Time Charter Equivalent Rate (“TCE rate”) is a non-GAAP measure. Please see EXHIBIT I at the end of this release for a reconciliation to Voyage Revenues, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Amounts shown throughout the press release and variations in period–over–period comparisons are derived from the actual unaudited numbers in our books and records. Reference to per share figures below are based on 96,139,203 and 102,541,314 weighted average diluted shares for the third quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Third Quarter 2023 and 2022 Results For the third quarter of 2023, we had a net income of $43.7 million, or $0.45 earnings per share, compared to a net income for the third quarter of 2022 of $109.7 million, or $1.07 earnings per share. Adjusted net income, which excludes certain non-cash items, was $33.1 million, or $0.34 earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023, compared to an adjusted net income of $136.3 million for the third quarter of 2022, or $1.33 earnings per share. Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2023 was $68.5 million, compared to $184.5 million for the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain non-cash items, was $84.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $189.9 million for the third quarter of 2022. Voyage revenues for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $223.1 million from $364.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 and Time charter equivalent revenues (“TCE Revenues”)1 were $162.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $266.7 million for the third quarter of 2022. TCE rate for the third quarter of 2023 was $15,068 per day compared to $24,365 per day for the third quarter of 2022 which is indicative of the weaker market conditions continuing to prevail during the recent quarter. For the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, vessel operating expenses were $54.9 million and $60.1 million, respectively. The decrease is mainly due to the decrease in the average number of vessels in our fleet to 121.5 in the third quarter of 2023 from 128.0 for the corresponding quarter of 2022. Vessel operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 included additional $0.7 million pre-delivery expenses, due to change of management of certain vessels from third party to in-house. Vessel operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 included additional crew expenses related to the increased number and cost of crew changes performed during the period as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions estimated to be $1.9 million and pre-delivery expenses due to change of management of $2.1 million. Drydocking expenses for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $11.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. During both periods eight vessels completed their periodic dry docking surveys. General and administrative expenses for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $13.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The stock based compensation expense for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $6.3 million compared to $11.9 million for the corresponding quarter in 2022. Vessel management fees for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $4.3 million from $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2022, due to the change of management of certain vessels, from third party to in-house, as described above. Our daily net cash general and administrative expenses per vessel (including management fees and excluding share-based compensation and other non-cash charges) for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $1,024 and $950, respectively. Depreciation expense decreased to $34.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $39.6 million for the corresponding period in 2022. The decrease is primarily driven by the change in the estimated scrap rate per light weight ton from $300 to $400 effective January 1, 2023, which resulted in lower depreciation expense by $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, together with the decrease in the average number of vessels in our fleet. Our results for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 include a loss on write-down of inventories of $0.8 million and $14.9 million, respectively, in connection with the valuation of the bunkers remaining on board our vessels, as a result of their lower net realizable value compared to their historical cost. Our results for the third quarter of 2023 include an aggregate net gain of $18.9 million which resulted from the completion of the sale of vessels Star Polaris, Star Centaurus, Star Columba, Star Aquila, Star Cepheus and Star Hercules. Interest and finance costs for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $18.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. The driving factor for this increase is the significant increase in variable interest rates, which was partially offset by the positive effect from our interest rate swaps and the decrease in our weighted average outstanding indebtedness as well as the recent refinancings of older facilities with more favorable terms. Interest income and other income/(loss) for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 amounted to $3.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The increase of interest income is attributable to both higher interest rates earned and higher cash balances maintained during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 as well as due to lower foreign exchange losses recognized in the current period compared to the corresponding period in 2022. Loss on debt extinguishment for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $4.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively and was primarily affected by increased write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the loan and lease prepayments in 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022.

TOKYO (AFP) -- Japan, Australia and Jurgen Klinsmann's South Korea will launch their qualifying campaigns on Thursday, Nov. 16, for the 2026 World Cup, with Palestine also among the 36 teams in action in Asia. A record eight direct spots and one intercontinental playoff berth are up for grabs for Asian Football Confederation sides at the expanded World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Nine groups of four in the AFC will play each other home and away, with the top two from each going through to the final qualifying round. Japan will be expected to book their place at an eighth straight World Cup after a phenomenal run of form since last year's tournament in Qatar, where they reached the last 16. The Blue Samurai have won their last six games, plundering 24 goals and conceding just five along the way. They travelled to Europe in September and beat Germany 4-1 and Turkey 4-2 -- results which cost both opposing managers their jobs. Hajime Moriyasu, whose side kick off their campaign against Myanmar in Osaka, warned that a Group B also featuring Syria and North Korea would not be easy. ""They are teams that wouldn't look out of place in the final round,"" the coach said, despite Japan thrashing Myanmar 10-0 at home when they met in 2022 World Cup qualifying. ""We can't afford to slack off and we need to keep striving to be better,"" he added. South Korea initially struggled when German legend Klinsmann took over as coach in February, but results have picked up in recent games. The Koreans scored 11 goals without reply in friendly wins over Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Vietnam, and begin their qualifying campaign at home to Singapore. China and Thailand have also been drawn in what looks like being one of the toughest groups of the qualifiers. ""We will be very serious with every World Cup qualifying game,"" said Klinsmann, who was without a win in his first five games in charge. ""Getting points right away is very important."" Australia, who joined Japan and South Korea in reaching the World Cup last 16 in Qatar, being their campaign against Bangladesh in Melbourne. Coach Graham Arnold told reporters that the time for ""experimenting is over"", with the Asian Cup in Qatar also just two months away. ""Now it's all about getting the tactics right and getting the players on the pitch and their performance right, and winning those games at all costs,"" he said. The Socceroos have also been drawn alongside Lebanon and Palestine in Group I. Palestine are away to Lebanon in their opener but the conflict between Israel and Hamas means they will play their home game against Australia on neutral ground in Kuwait next week. The first match day this week will be followed by the second on November 21 in Asia. This Thursday Iran are at home to Hong Kong while Saudi Arabia, who pulled off a stunning win over eventual champions Argentina at the Qatar World Cup, host Pakistan. Pakistan beat Cambodia in the preliminary round for their first-ever qualifying win. Qatar, now under the guidance of former Iran coach Carlos Queiroz, are at home to Afghanistan. Eighteen of Afghanistan's players are reportedly set to boycott the match in protest at what they describe as poor treatment by their country's football association. North Korea play their first World Cup qualifier since 2019 when they face Syria on neutral ground in Saudi Arabia. The North Koreans withdrew midway through 2022 qualifying when the Covid pandemic struck.",top,philippines,0.4394366197183099,710,27,26.296296296296298,66.373
50,13:04:46,"In fight to curb climate change, a grim report shows world is struggling to get on track",https://www.nsnews.com/environment-news/in-fight-to-curb-climate-change-a-grim-report-shows-world-is-struggling-to-get-on-track-7827248,"The world is off track in its efforts to curb global warming in 41 of 42 important measurements and is even heading in the wrong direction in six crucial ways, a new international report calculates. The only bright spot is that global sales of electric passenger vehicles are now on track to match what’s needed — along with many other changes — to limit future warming to just another couple tenths of a degree, according to the State of Climate Action report released Tuesday by the World Resources Institute, Climate Action Tracker, the Bezos Earth Fund and others. On the flip side, public money spent to create more fossil fuel use is going in the wrong direction and faster than it has in the past, said study co-author Kelly Levin, science and data director at the Bezos Earth Fund. “This is not the time for tinkering around the edges, but it’s instead the time for radical decarbonization of all sectors of the economy,” Levin said. “We are woefully off track and we are seeing the impact of inaction unfold around the world from extensive wildfire fires in Canada , heat-related deaths across the Mediterranean , record high temperatures in South Asia and so on,"" she said. Later this month, crucial international climate negotiations start in Dubai that include the first time world negotiators will do a global stocktake on how close society is to meeting its 2015 climate goals. In advance of the United Nations summit, numerous reports from experts are coming out assessing Earth’s progress or mostly the lack of it, including a United States national assessment with hundreds of indicators. Tuesday’s 42 indicators offers one of the grimmest report cards, detailing multiple failures of society. The report looks at what’s needed in several sectors of the global economy — power, transportation, buildings, industry, finance and forestry — to fit in a world that limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times, the goal the world adopted at Paris in 2015. The globe has already warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century. Six categories — the carbon intensity of global steel production, how many miles passenger cars drive, electric buses sold, loss of mangrove forests, amount of food waste and public financing of fossil fuel use — are going in the wrong direction, the report said. “Fossil fuel consumption subsidies in particular reached an all-time high last year, over $1 trillion, driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy price spikes,” said report co-author Joe Thwaites of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. Another six categories were considered “off track” but going in the right direction, which is the closest to being on track and better than the 24 measurements that are “well off track.” Those merely off track include zero-carbon electricity generation, electric vehicles as percentage of the fleet, two- and three-wheel electric vehicle sales, grazing animal meat production, reforestation and share of greenhouse gas emissions with mandatory corporate climate risk reporting requirements. People should be worried that this report is one of ’’too little, too late,” said University of Arizona climate scientist Katharine Jacobs, who wasn’t part of the report but praised it for being so comprehensive. “I am not shocked that at a global scale we are not meeting expectations for reducing emissions,” Jacobs said in an email. “We cannot ignore the fact that global commitments to (greenhouse gas) reductions are essentially unenforceable and that a number of major setbacks have taken a toll on our progress.” When trying to change an economy, the key is to start with “low-hanging fruit, i.e., the sectors of the economy that are easiest to transition and give a big bang for your buck,” said Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin, who isn’t part of the report. But he said the report shows “we’re really struggling to pick the low-hanging fruit.” ___ This story corrects Katharine Jacobs’ affiliation to University of Arizona, not Arizona State. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X, formerly known as Twitter, at @borenbears ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

51,13:19:19,Jewish protesters and allies stage sit-in at California federal building demanding Gaza cease-fire,https://www.nsnews.com/religion-news/jewish-protesters-and-allies-stage-sit-in-at-california-federal-building-demanding-gaza-cease-fire-7827452,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by Jewish peace activists calling for a cease fire in Gaza staged a sit-in inside of the federal building in Oakland, California, leading to multiple arrests. People wore T-shirts reading ""Jews Say Cease-fire Now” and carried banners that read “Not in Our Name” and “Let Gaza Live” in the rotunda of the Rondald V. Dellums Federal building on Monday evening. Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the protest organizers, posted online that dozens of people had been taken into custody by 9 p.m. Protesters were escorted outside of the building by U.S. Department of Homeland Security police. Messages were sent early Tuesday to the department and to Oakland police asking how many people were arrested and on what charges. “There is no other choice,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of Berkeley told KNTV-TV when explaining why she was at the sit-in. “How many people do we have to kill before we arrive at a cease fire?” The protest was part of a growing number across the country following fighting triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel , whose response has led to thousands of deaths — and much destruction — across Gaza. On Monday, hundreds of Jewish peace activists and their allies converged at a major train station in downtown Chicago during rush hour blocking the entrance to the Israeli consulate and demanding U.S. support for an Israel cease-fire. Jewish Voice for Peace led a similar sit-in in New York City’s Grand Central Station on Oct. 27, where a sea of protesters filled the main concourse during evening rush hour, chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. At least 200 demonstrators were detained by New York police officers. The Associated Press",top,canada,0.5787965616045845,349,15,23.266666666666666,57.561
52,10:12:00,Sergio Massa: “For me Thatcher is an enemy of the Argentine people”,https://en.mercopress.com/2023/11/14/sergio-massa-for-me-thatcher-is-an-enemy-of-the-argentine-people?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_content=international&utm_campaign=rss,"In a heated debate that unfolded on Sunday, Libertarian Congressman Javier Milei found himself at odds with Economy Minister Sergio Massa. The confrontation reached a boiling point as Milei accused Massa of employing the “falacia ad populum” strategy, dismissing technical discussions as if they were only meant for a select few, rather than the millions of voters they both aimed to represent. The exchange took a curious turn when Milei dodged a question about the rights of the Falkland Islanders, known as kelpers, in Argentina's sovereignty claims. Both candidates agreed that the sovereignty claims should not be abandoned, but Milei shifted the focus to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, hailing her as a world leader. This move further incited the nationalistic sentiments of the audience. Foreign relations became a focal point as Milei expressed his intention to sever ties with communist governments, such as China and Brazil, Argentina's major trading partners. Massa countered, emphasizing that foreign policy should be guided by national interest rather than whims. The clash intensified when Massa challenged Milei, asking outright, Is Margaret Thatcher your idol? Massa seized the opportunity to question Milei's consistency, urging voters to compare his statements at the University of Buenos Aires Law School with those made on various TV shows. The current Economy Minister accused Milei of employing the same strategy he criticized – the falacia ad populum. The Falklands/Malvinas issue resurfaced when Milei's potential Chancellor, in an interview with a British newspaper, suggested respecting the will of the island's inhabitants in future negotiations. Massa seized on this, reminding the audience of Milei's past praise for Margaret Thatcher on numerous TV shows. Milei's response, acknowledging Thatcher as a great leader, only fueled Massa's rebuttal. Massa emphatically declared, Thatcher is an enemy of Argentina, yesterday, today, and always. Our heroes are non-negotiable, no matter how much of a figure Thatcher is for you. This exchange underscored the deep ideological divide between the two candidates, with Massa defending Argentina's historical stance on the Falklands/Malvinas issue and Milei expressing admiration for a leader considered by many as a historical adversary.",world,venezuela,0.5365853658536586,410,16,25.625,30.479
53,13:36:26,Nintendo UK Black Friday 2023 has a Super Mario Wonder deal and £50 off,https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/14/nintendo-uk-black-friday-2023-a-super-mario-wonder-deal-gbp50-off-19821326/,"Console bundles and discounted games will be part of Nintendo’s Black Friday line-up, including money off all three models of console. Technically, Black Friday 2023 isn’t until November 24 but as has been the case for years now, as far as some companies are concerned it lasts practically the entire month. And even when it doesn’t they like to get people ready for upcoming deals as far in advance as possible. That’s already started to happen with Sony and their Call Of Duty bundles, as well as leaks suggesting major price cuts for the Xbox Series X. And now even the usually secretive Nintendo has started teasing what their offerings will be in the UK. It’s more than a tease really, they’ve just flat out stated what they’ll be. The only complication is that they haven’t yet said how cheap the games will be, but we’d avoid paying full price for any of the below until after this month. This is Nintendo, so you probably shouldn’t be expecting any massive savings. But then again, this may well be the Switch’s last Christmas before the introduction of its successor, so they may be a little more generous than usual. As you can see, the sales will start on Thursday, November 16 but the newer and/or more high profile games won’t be discounted until Monday, November 20. In both cases, the deals will last all the way until December 2. Although they’re not currently labelled as Black Friday on the Nintendo Store , the Switch Lite Aloha Edition console, which comes with a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is already £50 off at £199.99. There’s also a Nintendo Switch Sports bundle that comes with the game, the standard (not OLED) model console, three months of Nintendo Switch Online, and a leg strap (for the Joy-Con) and a free water bottle for £259.99, which is a saving of £46. On top of this is a Super Mario Bros. Wonder bundle that has a more modest saving of £20, that includes the game, a red Switch OLED Model, a case, and a set of pin badges for £359.98. Considering Wonder is brand new that’s still a pretty good deal, and while there may be other hardware deals once Black Friday starts they’re probably not going to be a whole lot cheaper.

54,12:01:27,US NSA warns of potential conflict in China-US relationship if not managed well,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/us-nsa-warns-of-potential-conflict-in-china-us-relationship-if-not-managed-well-23319845,"US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has cautioned that the relationship between the United States and has the potential to turn towards conflict if not handled well. This warning comes ahead of the anticipated summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sullivan emphasized the importance of effectively managing the complex and competitive nature of the relationship. ADVERTISEMENT The summit is expected to cover topics such as Taiwan, China's actions in the Indo-Pacific, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the war in , human rights, and trade disputes. Sullivan highlighted the need for open communication and responsible management of competition through intense diplomacy. The goal is not only to manage issues but also to achieve tangible results for both nations. Sullivan said the most important thing is that ""this is a complex and a competitive relationship that could easily veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed"". ""So, managing the relationship effectively is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file,"" Sullivan told reporters at a news conference here. Taiwan is likely to be at the top of the list of topics China will be keen to discuss with Biden. Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island, which is set to hold elections early next year. China has held provocative military exercises around Taiwan in recent months to warn the island against taking any steps to declare independence. The Israel-Hamas war, the war in Ukraine, human rights and trade disputes are expected to be discussed during the Biden-Xi meeting. Bilateral relations plunged to a new low last August when Beijing cut off major communication channels with Washington in retaliation for a high-level US visit to Taiwan. Attempts to restore dialogue were derailed this February when a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over American airspace. Since then, the US has spent months seeking to engage China, its biggest strategic rival, including dispatching four cabinet-level officials to Beijing in recent months. ""Those are some of the issues that, through intense diplomacy, we have been able to manage,"" Sullivan said. ""Then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interests overlap. I mentioned, for example, the issue of fentanyl. ""We're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week, and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things, but we're actually delivering tangible results,"" Sullivan said. ""Beyond that, the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries, including issues in moments of crisis like the Russia-Ukraine crisis. President Biden has had a number of candid conversations with President Xi about the question of military support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine,"" he said in response to a question. During the San Francisco meeting, Sullivan said that he anticipates the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US-China bilateral relationship, including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly. ""The way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy. That's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises. That's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people,"" he said. Sullivan said in recent months he met the Chinese Foreign Minister and Director of the ruling Communist Party of China Central Foreign Affairs Commission Wang Yi thrice, and top US secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce all went to Beijing. ""China for its part sent its vice president, foreign minister and other senior officials to the United States in recent months. President Biden comes into this summit on a solid footing, given the ways in which he has positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world,"" Sullivan said. Responding to questions, he talked about having lines of communication open to manage competition responsibly. ""That's what the (US) president has set out to achieve in this summit with President Xi. He sees this not just as a one-off meeting, but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future,"" Sullivan added. In Beijing, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the two presidents will have in-depth communication on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance in shaping China-US relations and major issues concerning world peace and development. ""China does not fear competition, but we do not agree that China-US relations should be defined by competition,"" Mao said. The US needs to respect China's concerns and legitimate right to development, rather than emphasising its own concerns at the expense of China's interests,"" she said on Monday. ""The Taiwan question is China's internal affair and resolving it is a matter for the Chinese that brook no foreign interference,"" Mao emphasised. She also noted that China has made clear on multiple occasions the nature of the South China Sea issue. ""China will neither take any inch of territory that is not ours, nor give up any inch of territory that belongs to us,"" Mao added.",world,india,0.3918918918918919,1036,38,27.263157894736842,47.022
55,12:41:58,Small Jewish communities emerge in Ivory Coast,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/13/small-jewish-communities-emerge-in-ivory-coast?traffic_source=rss,"In Pictures After completing her fifth prayer at the mosque one Friday evening this September, Fatimata Diallo made her way to Kol Yehuda, Ivory Coast’s first synagogue, where she recited her blessings in Hebrew during Shabbat services. Born and raised a Muslim, the 70-year-old’s life took a profound turn 10 years ago when she first heard about the Torah. She not only learned Hebrew but also adopted Orthodox Jewish practices, embracing Judaism alongside her Islamic faith. In Cote d’Ivoire, Judaism is fairly new, dating back to less than half a century. Yet in the heart of Abidjan, the economic capital of the West African country, other Ivorians, like Diallo are joining a small, emerging Jewish community. With the financial support of Kulanu, a New York-based organisation that seeks to bring Jews from isolated and emerging places together, Yehouda Firmin, leader of the Ivorian community, has been teaching the readings of the Torah and Jewish practices since 2001. There are now at least four different independent Jewish communities in Abidjan, each with their respective synagogues. Today, sub-Saharan Africa is still the region with the lowest Jewish population in the world; most communities in the region have not been recognised by Israel. Like in most African nations, it is hard to quantify the Jewish community. Like in most African nations, it is hard to quantify the Jewish community. The latest census, in 2021, contains no available data on the number of Jews in Côte d’Ivoire. Firmin estimates that there are about 300 people who attend the religious services at the Kol Yehuda Synagogue and the other three Jewish communities estimate between 30 and 230 members each. In Cote d’Ivoire, nearly 43 percent of the population are Muslims while Christians account for about 40 percent of the population. This has played a significant role in the political landscape centred on a rivalry between current President Alassane Ouattara, largely supported by Muslims in the north, and his predecessor and rival Laurent Gbagbo, supported by Christians in the south. Like Diallo, many other Ivorians with a Christian or Muslim background who are interested in Judaism have integrated both sets of practices into their lives. Kulanu representatives say one reason for this is the difficulty of fully incorporating all Jewish traditions and practices in Africa. Another is that these new converts face potential isolation by those in their community who, due to their unfamiliarity with Judaism, erroneously associate the religion with witchcraft. Kulanu co-founder Bonita Sussman explains that the internet has helped in spreading the teachings of the Old Testament across sub-Saharan Africa, where some see the expansion of Judaism as a way to dissociate faith from imperialism. “They google Judaism and they, too, find it interesting,” Sussman said, referencing her conversation with multiple newly converted Jews across the region. “They admire Israel and they admire that the Jewish people were able to build their own state after the Holocaust. After their colonial experience, they could learn from it, and build their own country.” Since 2012, Kulanu has been sending Torahs and books about Judaism to the synagogue. The organisation also brought a rabbinical court to perform 40 conversions and participated in Cote d’Ivoire’s first Jewish wedding ceremonies, marrying six couples. “We’re not there to change their practice,” Sussman said. “We’re here to put them on the map.”",top,united states of america,0.49059561128526646,638,25,25.52,48.888
56,09:23:09,Indian woman evacuated from war-torn Gaza,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/indian-woman-evacuated-from-war-torn-gaza/articleshow/105206657.cms,"Synopsis The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. PTI An Indian woman from Kashmir who had sought immediate evacuation from the war-torn Hamas-ruled Gaza has safely reached Egypt with the help of Indian missions in the region, according to her husband. Lubna Nazir Shaboo and her daughter Karima, crossed the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Monday evening. ""They are in al-Arish (a city in Egypt). Tomorrow morning (Tuesday) they will move to Cairo,"" Lubna's husband Nedal Toman said in a text message sent to PTI from Gaza. The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region -- in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo -- for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. ""We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,"" she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their ""water supply was officially cut off"" in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn't seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A Revanth Reddy.(ANI) “Everybody knows who he is working for...Since Congress won in Karnataka, Asaduddin Owaisi and KCR are sad which means they made efforts for BJP to win,” the Congress chief told ANI. Catch the full coverage of the Telangana elections. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Reddy further challenged Owaisi and his party to help them defeat the BJP in the Goshamahal Assembly Constituency. ""That's the reason why you don't need to discuss BJP's Team B and if you have the daring then help in defeating BJP in Goshamahal Assembly Constituency then people will get to know your real intention,"" Reddy was quoted as saying by the news agency. Owaisi and Reddy have lately been engaged in a war of words during the campaign for the coming Assembly elections in Telangana. On Monday, Owaisi had accused Reddy of doing ""dog whistle politics"" targeting the minority class. Owaisi had said that Reddy had nothing substantial to criticize and was resorting to personal attacks. ""You (Revanth Reddy) don't have anything to criticise against us. You speak about our clothes and beards and attack us. It is called dog whistle politics. You are an RSS puppet. There is no difference between the BJP and the Congress,"" Asaduddin Owaisi said at a public rally in Hyderabad. The verbal spat started when Reddy took a swipe at Owaisi, alleging that the AIMIM leader “wears a khaki knicker under his sherwani”. Both Congress and AIMIM have been trying to label each other as the ‘B’ team of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Even cutouts depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi controlling Owaisi and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao were put up in Hyderabad last week. ""Telangana PCC chief started as an RSS member wearing a chaddi and then went to ABVP, then joined Telugu Desam and now comes to Congress. Someone said it right that Congress's Gandhi Bhavan is captured by Mohan Bhagwat and will run Congress however he wants,"" the AIMIM chief said. The ruling BRS had also stepped up its attack on Congress, with the party's working president and minister K T Rama Rao accusing the grand old party of using minority communities as a vote bank. Telangana will undergo assembly elections on November 30. The counting of votes, along with those of four other poll-bound states, has been scheduled for December 3. ""Exciting news!

59,11:35:16,I look just like WHO?! Watch Five Finger Death Punch frontman Ivan Moody get recognised in public...as the singer from Disturbed. Whoops!,https://www.loudersound.com/news/ffdp-ivan-moody-disturbed-david-draiman,"Being a heavy metal celebrity must be a bit of an odd experience. Most of the time, you can probably carry on with your day without getting hassled by strangers or asked for selfies in unusual places. Walk past someone in a black t-shirt with a lairy logo on it, however, and you'll at least get a surprised, delighted look or two. Head into a metal bar or a festival and you might just get mobbed. Surely, though, you'd imagine the odds of you a) getting recognised and b) getting confused for can't happen all that much. But that's exactly what happened to frontman Ivan Moody while innocently pulling up to the drive through at a fast food restaurant recently. The person serving him clearly realised that she was dealing with a heavy metal musician. As it turns out, though, it wasn't actually the one she thought. ""So I just pulled up to Taco John's, and this young lady right here just asked me if I was in a band, and I was like, 'Yes!'"" says Ivan in a video taken immediately after the encounter that he has since posted to social media. Ivan turns to the lady in the window of the fast food restaurant before adding: ""And she said I looked just like who?"" ""The lead singer from !"" replies the fast food server jovially. Yes, it turns out she thought poor Ivan was actually David Draiman, our favourite, monkey noise-making Disturbed singer. Clearly taking the whole thing in good jest, Moody turns back to the camera to send his fellow bald metal icon some appreciation: ""I love you Dave."" Watch the video for yourself below. Five Finger Death Punch's most recent album, , was released last year. Disturbed's latest album, , was also released in 2022. That's where the comparisons can end though, alright?!

60,07:56:32,"As fighting empties north Gaza, humanitarian crisis worsens in south",https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/11/14/as-fighting-empties-north-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-worsens-in-south/,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Another 200,000 people have fled northern Gaza since Nov. 5, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday, as Israeli ground forces battle Palestinian militants around hospitals where patients, newborns and medics are stranded with no electricity and dwindling supplies. The humanitarian office, known as OCHA, says only one hospital in the north is capable of receiving patients. All the others are no longer able to function and mostly serve as shelters from the fighting, including Gaza’s largest, Shifa, which is surrounded by Israeli troops and where 36 babies are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel, in which militants massacred hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. Israel launched heavy airstrikes for nearly three weeks before sending troops and tanks into the north. The war has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished coastal enclave. Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes from north to south, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. U.N.-run shelters in the south are severely overcrowded, with an average of one toilet for 160 people. In all, some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no fuel for water pumps or treatment plants. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it was unable to continue importing limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. With Israeli forces fighting Palestinian militants in the center of Gaza City, the territory’s main city, both sides have seized on the plight of hospitals. Images of doctors trying to keep newborns warm at Shifa have circulated widely. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters, alleging that Hamas has set up its main command center in and beneath Shifa, without providing visual evidence. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the Israeli allegations. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes the militants were holding hostages. “Hamas uses hospitals as an instrument of war,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the army’s chief spokesperson, standing in a room of the Rantisi Children’s Hospital decorated with a colorful children’s drawing of a tree. Explosive vests, grenades and RPGs were displayed on the floor. Meanwhile, gunfire and explosions raged Monday around Shifa, which Israeli troops encircled over the weekend. Tens of thousands of people have fled the hospital in the past few days and headed to the southern Gaza Strip, including large numbers of displaced people who had taken shelter there. For weeks, Shifa staff members running low on supplies have performed surgery on war-wounded patients, including children, without anesthesia and using vinegar as antiseptic. After the weekend’s mass exodus, about 650 patients and 500 staff remain in the hospital, which can no longer function, along with around 2,500 displaced Palestinians sheltering inside with little food or water. The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said 32 patients, including three babies, have died since its emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. It said 36 babies, as well as other patients, are at risk of dying because life-saving equipment cannot function. Early Tuesday, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had started an effort to transfer incubators from Israel to Shifa. It wasn’t clear if the incubators had been delivered or how they will be powered. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. The International Committee of the Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 patients, staff and displaced people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds. But the Red Cross said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. Israel released a video showing what it said was a militant with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher entering Al-Quds Hospital. An Israeli tank was stationed nearby. The U.S. has pushed for temporary pauses to allow wider distribution of badly needed aid. Israel has agreed only to daily windows during which civilians can flee northern Gaza on foot along two main roads. As of last Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. Health officials have not updated the toll, citing the difficulty of collecting information. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. Palestinian militants. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire since the start of the war. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

61,11:30:25,Morning Report — Democrats open to Speaker’s funding fallback,https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/4308412-democrats-open-to-speakers-funding-fallback/,"Whew. A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday.

There is only one approved treatment that can cure sickle cell disease: a bone marrow transplant, for which finding a compatible donor can be difficult.

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

The 35-year-old Chinese wrestler has been rejuvenated in recent weeks, having previously taken out Candice LeRae last month, forcing their match to be halted by the referee. This week, she repeated the feat with Candice at ringside as Xia took on Indi Hartwell in singles action, with the latter looking for a measure of revenge for her tag team partner. Partway through the bout, Xia rocked her opponent with her signature spinning kick, rocking her as Indi appeared dazed and staggered around before dropping to her feet. She went to go on the attack but the referee intervened and cancelled the match, calling it off and awarding the win to the dominating star, who has been rejuvenated recently. Just last week, she laid out Becky Lynch with that same strike as The Man was making her way to the ring for the Battle Royal which was to determine Rhea Ripley’s number one contender for the Women’s World Championship. Thanks to Xia, Becky was unable to compete in the match – which was won by Zoey Stark – and she returned on Monday night looking for revenge. She came out to confront her rival, who tried to cheap shot her as she got into the ring, before making a strategic choice to roll out and wait to fight another day. The feud between the two stars is already picking up steam, and it marks a real rise for Xia after she has previously struggled to find her feet on Raw or SmackDown. Before beating Candice on October 30, she had largely been seen losing match on WWE’s streaming show Main Event going back to early June. She had rarely appeared on SmackDown either, and lost whenever she did ever since beating Natalya in February 2022 in her televised debut for the blue brand.

66,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679
67,09:38:06,BBC EastEnders' second Christmas death 'sealed' by clue in new Kathy Beale trailer,https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/bbc-eastenders-second-christmas-death-31432649,"fans are convinced a second victim could be revealed on Day. And it's all because of a new trailer showing Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) cutting the heads off of roses. The 'everything changes' trailer shows the matriarch banging a meat cleaver into the board and snipping the heads off of what appear to be pink roses. She slams the cleaver into the flowerheads and destroys them after a bell tolls, prompting her mood to completely change. Fans reckon it could suggest Cindy Beale might be killed off by Kathy, given that she was known as Rose Knight when she was in witness protection. Fans flocked to X to share the death theory. One wrote: ""Symbolising the loss of love and devotion... Rockys betrayal when she finds out he caused the fire? She did say there'll be murders before Christmas... killer Kathy??? So excited for the last part of the puzzle.... SUKIS TRAILER #EastEnders."" Another said: ""SHE CUT ROSES? ROSE? CINDY??"". A third simply wanted Cindy gone as they can't stand her. ""Get Cindy back in witness protection or dead for real this time, just anything!! Get her OFF my screen."" A fourth reckoned the flowers weren't roses and were in fact tulips and had another theory. ""I thought they was Roses (as in she wants to kill Cindy/“Rose”) but I think they’re tulips lol. #EastEnders They’re pink tho. Linda? Does Kathy kill Dean to protect Linda?"" Indeed, Cindy has just had Kathy, her mother-in-law, arrested for the cafe fire. If Kathy finds out, she'd be fuming. There are trailers for each of the Six women standing over the unnamed body in the Queen Vic teasing their involvement in the death. The ladies in question are Kathy, Denise (Diane Parish), Sharon (Letitia Dean), Linda (Kellie Bright), Stacey (Lacey Turner) and Suki (Balvinder Sopal). Five of the six trailers have been released, but Kathy is the only member of the Six to be carrying a potential weapon - and it's not the first time she's used a knife as she defended herself against Wilmott-Brown in 2017. This could be a sign that she's the Christmas killer.",entertainment,united kingdom,0.5497737556561086,442,28,15.785714285714286,87.008

Follow LIVE updates on Israel-Hamas war The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region -- in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo -- for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. ""We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,"" she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their ""water supply was officially cut off"" in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn't seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.

Zionism is a movement supporting the re-establishment, and protection, of a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel. Unrest has continued to grow in Palestine over the last few weeks, after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, leaving at least 1,200 people dead. The tensions have escalated amid retaliatory attacks, with Gazan health officials reporting that the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 11,000. Many have called for a ceasefire, with stars making their voices heard amid the brutal fighting. Gal Gadot and Amy Schumer have spoken out on social media, while Schnapp was slated for his response last month. Zionism is a Jewish political movement aimed at stamping out antisemitism by establishing a Jewish state. ‘Zion’ means Jerusalem in Hebrew, and so ‘Zionism’ centres around having a homeland in the land around that area – which at the time was Palestine, controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The land was inhabited by an Arab majority and a Jewish minority, and for a while, both groups coexisted in relative peace. But tensions mounted when Britain took on the task of establishing a ‘national home’ for the Jewish people, issued through the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Both the Arabs and the Jews claim the region as their ancestral home, and as more Jews arrived between the 1920s and 1940s, violence between both groups and British rule grew. In 1947 the UN voted for Palestine to be split into two states, one for the Jews and one for the Arabs, with Jerusalem as an international city. Israel as a state was admitted into the UN on May 11, 1948 and gained its first president Chaim Weizmann, the president of the Zionist Organization in 1949. ‘As a Jewish American, I am afraid,’ he began a lengthy statement – which is still visible on his Instagram page. ‘Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel, who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas. I am truly heartbroken to see the brutal murders of innocent children, women and soldiers fighting to defend themselves. ‘I, like others, want peace for both Palestinians and Israelis. Let’s stop the rhetoric and choosing sides. Instead we must recognize that we are all on the side of the fight against terrorism. Choose humanity over violence. ‘You don’t have to be Jewish, you don’t have to be Israeli, you just have to have empathy and common sense to know that THIS is wrong. ‘I have also noticed a silence in social media like never seen before. The same people who love to jump on fashionable causes like supporting Ukraine and combating climate change have been chillingly quiet. The Jewish people are seeing your silence and won’t forget it. ‘I hope we can agree that Hamas are a recognised terrorist organisation; they don’t represent the Palestinian people when they value murdering Israelis more than protecting their own. You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism. It shouldn’t be a difficult choice. Shame on you.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Schnapp’s reps for a comment. Got a story?

72,13:07:49,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

73,07:54:31,"Myanmar fighting intensifies near India border, curfew imposed in Sittwe",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/myanmar-fighting-intensifies-near-india-border-curfew-imposed-in-sittwe?traffic_source=rss,"Ethnic armed groups fighting to restore civilian rule in Myanmar have claimed new territory in the country’s northwest near the border with India, amid an escalating offensive against the military regime. Fighters in reportedly took control of two military outposts on the border of India’s Mizoram state after hours-long battles on Monday, according to local media outlets. The advance follows successes in neighbouring Rakhine state and northern Shan state in a launched two weeks ago by anti-coup forces. Myanmar was plunged into crisis when Senior General Min Aung Hlaing seized power in a coup in 2021, leading to mass protests that evolved into armed resistance when the military used force to crack down on its civilian opponents. About 80 fighters mounted attacks on Rihkhawdar and Khawmawi military camps in Chin state in the early hours of Monday, eventually taking control of both outposts after several hours of fighting, Chin National Front (CNF) Vice Chairman Sui Khar told the Reuters news agency. The CNF will now look to consolidate its control along the India-Myanmar border, where the Myanmar military has two more camps, he said. “We’ll move forward,” Sui Khar said. “Our tactic is from the village to the town to the capital.” The generals, who have the scale of the challenge posed to their regime, have expanded martial law to more parts of the country amid the intensified conflict. Social media posts said a nighttime curfew had been imposed in Sittwe, Rakhine’s capital, with some reports of tanks on the streets. “We saw tanks going around the town. Many shops are closed today,” a resident told Reuters, declining to be named for security reasons. Fighting was taking place across Rakhine, according to two residents and a spokesperson for the Arakan Army (AA), a group fighting for greater autonomy that has seized military posts in Rathedaung and Minbya towns. A Rathedaung resident told Reuters on Tuesday the area came under artillery fire overnight and that the military had entered the town. “Artillery fell on a street in Rathedaung town last night. No immediate report of injured or casualties yet,” said the resident, who asked not to be identified. “People have started fleeing the town. Soldiers are in the town now.” Despite its brutal history of and the , Rakhine emerged as one of the more peaceful parts of the country after the coup, thanks to an informal ceasefire between the AA and the military agreed just a few months before. The arrangement began to by November 2021, as the AA entrenched its political control over the state. The AA was established in 2009 to push for self-determination within Myanmar and mostly represents ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who make up the majority of the state’s population. Many of the country’s other ethnic armed groups have been fighting the military for decades.",top,united states of america,0.48880597014925375,536,23,23.304347826086957,57.839
74,09:00:26,DRC elections: the Kabila family legacy looms large over the country’s polls,https://www.ebnewsdaily.co.za/2023/11/14/drc-elections-the-kabila-family-legacy-looms-large-over-the-countrys-polls/,"The Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to hold elections on 20 December 2023. The country’s electoral commission has announced President Felix Tshisekedi will be seeking reelection alongside 23 other candidates . They include Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege and the runner-up in the 2018 presidential election, Martin Fayulu . The courts will confirm the final list of candidates. One key political figure has yet to make his intentions known: Joseph Kabila. He was president for 18 years until Tshisekedi took over in 2019. The DRC’s constitution allows two five-year terms , but he remained in power by delaying elections . He holds substantial political, military and business sway. Jonathan R. Beloff is a political scholar who researches the politics and security of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. We asked him some questions. What is the Kabila family’s place in the DRC’s politics? Joseph Kabila was the country’s fourth president. He took office after the assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who was killed by his bodyguard in 2001. Joseph later won presidential elections in 2006 and 2011 . The surprise 2018 election of Felix Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019, as president interrupted more than two decades of the Kabila family’s rule. At the time, Joseph was constitutionally barred from running for president – and he had already overshot his second term by more than three years. The Kabila family became a political powerhouse after gaining control in 1996. With the assistance of other countries – such as neighbours Uganda, Angola and Rwanda – the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, under the leadership of Laurent Kabila, overthrew the long-standing Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. This was during the First Congo War (1996-1997). Laurent’s tenure was riddled with ineffectiveness and corruption . In less than two years, he had dismissed his minister of defence, the Rwandan James Kabarebe, and begun arming anti-Rwandan forces. These forces contained actors who participated in the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Laurent claimed his government only backed these forces after Rwanda attempted to overthrow his regime. The bloody Second Congo War (1998-2003) led to at least two million deaths, many of them from disease and extreme poverty rather than warfare itself. While Kabarebe’s invasion attempt on the capital Kinshasa in 1998 failed , the vast DRC was divided into spheres of influence for different nations and their aligned rebel groups. This status quo only began to break after Laurent’s assassination, which led to the rise of his son Joseph. Joseph learned military strategy, tactics and politics under Kabarebe. The two worked together after the Second Congo War to flush out many anti-Rwandan forces . This included the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. They also campaigned together during the 2011 presidential elections, which Joseph won. Joseph initially cast himself as a reformer who would end the Second Congo War and pursue policies to spur political and economic development. However, instability in eastern Congo persisted under his rule, with accusations of massive corruption that undermined the nation’s development . How much sway does Joseph Kabila hold today? Joseph Kabila remains a strong presence within Congo’s political, economic and military institutions. He has strong networks developed over 18 years in power . He could use this influence to sway the vote towards any of the candidates. His influence stems from favourable business and political alliances he created when he was president. Like Mobutu, Kabila used his vast financial resources to secure favourable relationships with Congolese and foreign business leaders. A document leak in 2021 revealed that Kabila received over US$138 million from corruption and bribes. There were claims that the former president originally convinced Tshisekedi to accept a power-sharing agreement. Under it, Tshisekedi would be president, while Kabila would control political decisions behind the scenes. The near appointment of Ronsard Malonda as the president of the electoral body illustrated Kabila’s political influence. Malonda held senior positions during the country’s 2006, 2011 and 2018 elections. He has been accused of rigging results in favour of Kabila. Such accusations have benefited Tshisekedi’s election campaign . He is depicting himself as a candidate not tied to the corruption within DRC. If Kabila does decide to campaign, political dynamics within much of Congo’s civil society, military and economy will be divided. Government ministers and officials will be forced to choose to support either the incumbent or Kabila’s preferred candidate. What was Tshisekedi expected to change after he routed Joseph Kabila? There was initial hope that Tshisekedi’s government would foster peace in eastern Congo, establish greater national unity and help solve the nation’s economic woes after decades of corruption and conflict. However, these problems have persisted. Initially, Amnesty International praised Tshisekedi for pardoning political prisoners and allowing greater public space for criticisms of the Congolese government. He also began investigations on past mineral deals during the Kabila governments. As the African Union chair from 2021 to 2022, he pushed for greater attention to the COVID-19 pandemic and promoted the African Continental Free Trade Area. Despite initial attempts to foster more significant relations with Rwanda, relations soured in 2022. This was after the Congolese government accused Rwanda of supporting the resurrected M23 rebels . Rwanda denied the allegations. It has also accused Tshisekedi’s government of being hostile to the Congolese Tutsi population – the Banyamulenge – who are historically related to Rwandans. The US Department of State has expressed concern about Tshisekedi’s anti-Banyamulenge rhetoric, as well as democratic transparency in the upcoming election. Tshisekedi’s campaign strategy seems to focus on promoting security in eastern DRC by not only defeating the M23, but also attacking Rwanda for interfering in Congolese affairs. The securitisation of the Banyamulenge and Rwanda – the political manipulation to stir public fear – has helped deflect internal criticisms of the Tshisekedi regime. Whether the elections take place is another area of concern. There are concerns that Tshisekedi will delay or cancel the election by citing security concerns. If this happens, it might be perceived by domestic and international partners as political interference by the ruling regime.",top,south africa,0.4227430555555556,1152,64,18.0,43.849
75,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

It is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, and a former employee at its nuclear reactor served 18 years in Israeli prison for leaking details and pictures of Israel's alleged nuclear arsenal programme to a British newspaper in 1986. Agencies Representative Image China, Iran and a multitude of Arab nations condemned an Israeli minister's statement that a nuclear bomb on the Gaza Strip was an option in the Israel-Hamas war , calling it a threat to the world. At Monday's long-planned opening of a United Nations conference whose goal is to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, many ambassadors expressed condemnations and criticisms of comments by Israel 's Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu, who later called his remarks in a radio interview on Sunday ""metaphorical"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly disavowed the comments and suspended him from cabinet meetings. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its nuclear capability. It is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, and a former employee at its nuclear reactor served 18 years in Israeli prison for leaking details and pictures of Israel's alleged nuclear arsenal programme to a British newspaper in 1986. China's deputy UN ambassador Geng Shuang said Beijing was ""shocked"", calling the statements ""extremely irresponsible and disturbing"" and should be universally condemned. He urged Israeli officials to retract the statement and become a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament, as a non-nuclear weapon state ""as soon as possible"". Geng said China is ready to join other countries ""to inject new impetus"" to establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Mideast, saying there is greater urgency because of the situation in the current region. UN disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu, who opened Monday's fourth conference, didn't mention Israel. But she said: ""Any threat to use nuclear weapons is inadmissible."" Nakamitsu reiterated the ""urgency ... of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction"", stressing that ""cool heads and diplomatic efforts"" must prevail to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians, based on a two-state solution. Oman's UN Ambassador Mohamed Al-Hassan, speaking on behalf of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council which includes Saudi Arabia, said the threat to use nuclear weapons in Gaza ""reaffirms the extremes and brutality of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people"" and their ""disregard for innocent life"". He called on the UN Security Council and the IAEA to take decisive action on the matter. Lebanon's Charge d'Affaires Hadi Hachem also condemned the Israeli heritage minister's comments, stressing that ""this self-acknowledgment of having nuclear weapons and the threat of using them by its officials, poses a serious threat to both regional and international peace and security"". He urged Israel to stop ""such rhetoric or posturing"" and join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state. Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Iravani told the conference the nuclear threats directed toward Palestinians by high-ranking Israeli officials highlight Israel's ""pride"" in having these weapons in its hands. ""The secrecy surrounding Israel's nuclear capabilities poses a significant threat to regional stability,"" he said. ""In these critical times, the imperative to establish such a zone in the Middle East has never been more urgent."" Israel did not speak Monday but Netanyahu has said his country's biggest threat remains the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, and it is prepared to prevent that from happening. Efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone date back to the 1960s and include a call by parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 and a 1998 General Assembly resolution asking countries to contribute to establishing it. The first UN conference aimed at creating a zone was held in November 2019. Russia's ambassador to the IAEA and other UN organisations based in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told delegates on Monday that given the new escalation of violence in the Middle East, a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region ""is more pertinent than ever"". But he said Moscow is ""extremely uncomfortable"" that along with the two other sponsors of the 1995 resolution - the United States and the United Kingdom - the promise to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Mideast has not been met after almost 30 years. And for more than 20 years, ""there's been almost no progress whatsoever"", he said. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

77,13:07:49,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

78,12:01:27,US NSA warns of potential conflict in China-US relationship if not managed well,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/us-nsa-warns-of-potential-conflict-in-china-us-relationship-if-not-managed-well-23319845,"US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has cautioned that the relationship between the United States and has the potential to turn towards conflict if not handled well. This warning comes ahead of the anticipated summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sullivan emphasized the importance of effectively managing the complex and competitive nature of the relationship. ADVERTISEMENT The summit is expected to cover topics such as Taiwan, China's actions in the Indo-Pacific, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the war in , human rights, and trade disputes. Sullivan highlighted the need for open communication and responsible management of competition through intense diplomacy. The goal is not only to manage issues but also to achieve tangible results for both nations. Sullivan said the most important thing is that ""this is a complex and a competitive relationship that could easily veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed"". ""So, managing the relationship effectively is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file,"" Sullivan told reporters at a news conference here. Taiwan is likely to be at the top of the list of topics China will be keen to discuss with Biden. Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island, which is set to hold elections early next year. China has held provocative military exercises around Taiwan in recent months to warn the island against taking any steps to declare independence. The Israel-Hamas war, the war in Ukraine, human rights and trade disputes are expected to be discussed during the Biden-Xi meeting. Bilateral relations plunged to a new low last August when Beijing cut off major communication channels with Washington in retaliation for a high-level US visit to Taiwan. Attempts to restore dialogue were derailed this February when a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over American airspace. Since then, the US has spent months seeking to engage China, its biggest strategic rival, including dispatching four cabinet-level officials to Beijing in recent months. ""Those are some of the issues that, through intense diplomacy, we have been able to manage,"" Sullivan said. ""Then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interests overlap. I mentioned, for example, the issue of fentanyl. ""We're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week, and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things, but we're actually delivering tangible results,"" Sullivan said. ""Beyond that, the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries, including issues in moments of crisis like the Russia-Ukraine crisis. President Biden has had a number of candid conversations with President Xi about the question of military support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine,"" he said in response to a question. During the San Francisco meeting, Sullivan said that he anticipates the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US-China bilateral relationship, including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly. ""The way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy. That's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises. That's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people,"" he said. Sullivan said in recent months he met the Chinese Foreign Minister and Director of the ruling Communist Party of China Central Foreign Affairs Commission Wang Yi thrice, and top US secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce all went to Beijing. ""China for its part sent its vice president, foreign minister and other senior officials to the United States in recent months. President Biden comes into this summit on a solid footing, given the ways in which he has positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world,"" Sullivan said. Responding to questions, he talked about having lines of communication open to manage competition responsibly. ""That's what the (US) president has set out to achieve in this summit with President Xi. He sees this not just as a one-off meeting, but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future,"" Sullivan added. In Beijing, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the two presidents will have in-depth communication on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance in shaping China-US relations and major issues concerning world peace and development. ""China does not fear competition, but we do not agree that China-US relations should be defined by competition,"" Mao said. The US needs to respect China's concerns and legitimate right to development, rather than emphasising its own concerns at the expense of China's interests,"" she said on Monday. ""The Taiwan question is China's internal affair and resolving it is a matter for the Chinese that brook no foreign interference,"" Mao emphasised. She also noted that China has made clear on multiple occasions the nature of the South China Sea issue. ""China will neither take any inch of territory that is not ours, nor give up any inch of territory that belongs to us,"" Mao added.",world,india,0.3918918918918919,1036,38,27.263157894736842,47.022
79,12:00:00,Saudi Arabia wants the Indian Premier League: Why is there no discussion of 'sportswashing'?,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4306629-saudi-arabia-wants-the-indian-premier-league-why-is-there-no-discussion-of-sportswashing/,"Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman previously said he does not care about allegations of “sportswashing” against his country, and that he would continue investing in sports if it adds to his country’s gross domestic product. Saudi Arabia’s recent expression of interest in buying a $5 billion stake in cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL), with a plan to place the IPL in a holding company worth up to $30 billion, only reinforces bin Salman’s seriousness about investing in sports. Saudi officials reportedly see an opportunity to massively expand the league presence internationally, including within the kingdom, similar to the English Premier League or the European Champions League Allegations of “sportswashing,” in this situation — of using sports to burnish a nation’s dodgy reputation — haven’t been aggressively levelled against the kingdom, a stark contrast to the or the contracts for , who both now play for Saudi football teams. The rather quiet response from western politicians is telling of several things as they relate to Saudi Arabia on the global stage. First, sportswashing can be a lazy rebuttal to the kingdom’s investment in sports and, in general, the Middle East. The definition of “sportswashing,” which is the practice of using sports to improve reputation, can be rather expansive in practice. Yes, we can all agree Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup to elevate the reputation of the country. So did Brazil with the 2016 Summer Olympics and South Africa with the 2010 World Cup and so will countries in the future. Saudi officials clearly know that sports can bring good attention to a country. (The Ministry of Culture has from NBA great Lebron James’s visit during September this year…yes Lebron James was in Saudi Arabia.) That said, it is not the sole reason for investing in sports, but it is obviously low-hanging fruit for politicians, because it will always contain some truth. Saudi Arabia is moving at a fast pace to change the country, and it has deep pockets to do so. Critics will note that women weren’t allowed to vote until 2011 and could not independently access health care and education without male supervision until 2017. Women also could not drive until 2018. For context, bin Salman began his rise to power in 2013, when he was named head of the Crown Prince’s Court with the rank of minister. He would be named crown prince in June 2017, when King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud deposed Muhammad bin Nayef. Since bin Salman has become crown prince, the country has hosted major boxing matches (such Anthony Joshua versus Andy Ruiz in 2019), launched LIV Golf in 2021 (which by 2023 was merged with the PGA tour) and took over Newcastle United in 2021. Additionally, Saudi football club Al-Nassr welcomed Ronaldo to the team at the start of this year, and, last month Riyadh was host to a boxing match between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou (with stars such as Kanye West and Mike Tyson in attendance) as a kickoff to Riyadh Season, which is a major festival where the city will host a series of huge shows and spectacles alongside a series of sporting events. Most of the Saudi sovereign deals have been executed via the country’s Public Investment Fund, which has reportedly made overtures in recent years to buy the WWE and Formula One. An investment in the IPL by the Public Investment Fund (or another entity) would fit well with the Saudis’ other sports investments — the IPL, for example, received sponsor bids up $6.2 billion for the right to broadcast games through 2027, which equates roughly to $15 million per match in a sport where the season lasts eight weeks. The per-match number is more than the English Premier League and slightly behind the $17 million per game for the National Football League in the U.S. Let’s also not forget that the kingdom has a significant Indian population between 10 and 12 percent who will be happy to have more access to IPL games. The push by Saudi Arabia (and other non-Western countries) into sports is fueling a “West versus everyone else” type of narrative. The quiet response to the reported offer for IPL versus the stir caused by LIV Golf (in competition with the PGA) suggests two different responses for deals done in the East versus deals done in the West. The PGA is sacred in the U.S. The IPL is unknown to Americans, so there are no political points to be gained by pushing back against this deal. However, the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, has also surprisingly faced little pushback for its estimated $200 million investment in Leonsis’s Monumental Sports, which controls the NBA’s Washington Wizards, the NHL’s Washington Capitals and the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. Qatar’s is the first sovereign fund to purchase a stake in a team in the top four U.S. sports leagues. (MLS club New York City FC is majority-controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi.) Skeptics will say Qatar is becoming an important ally to the U.S., so there is little political upside to criticizing this deal. (For example, Qatar is the go-between with Hamas for Israel and the U.S.) Countries accused of sportswashing are largely non-western countries, such as Qatar with the 2022 World Cup and China with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Was the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics an example of sportswashing? Or, how do we distinguish between the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in this conversation? Are both examples of sportswashing, or only the 2022 games? Historians can reference the 1934 World Cup in Mussolini’s Italy and the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, but that retroactive application of sportswashing ignores how little the language of sportswashing was used before the 2000s (or even 2010s). One can even argue that Hitler hosted the Olympics in 1936 to prove the superiority of the “pure German” race over any other race, only to have black American athlete Jesse Owens star in the games. Eighteen black athletes would participate in those 1936 games (and elevate the prominence of the U.S.) only to be forgotten and dismissed upon their return home to the U.S. That time in history was more about proving superiority of countries and races than it was about sportswashing. Regardless, Saudi Arabia is not Nazi Germany or Mussolini’s Italy and nor does not have the U.S. 1936 racial issues. Furthermore, the West as the arbitrator of who is sportswashing based on human rights has generally permitted those best allied to the West to escape criticism more than those less allied to the U.S. This positioning of countries on a theoretical human rights spectrum obfuscates the conversation on sportswashing by masking over the behaviors of certain countries versus others to maintain Western moral superiority. The discussion in this fashion also muddies the waters by ignoring any complicity of other countries in alleged human rights violations. Indeed, it may be better to ask why we should care if any country is sportswashing. Individuals and countries can boycott “problem” countries by avoiding travel to those countries, not participating in certain games or sports in those countries, or cutting aid and investment within those countries, if they feel obliged to do so. Sports organizers and leaders, for their part, may simply want to avoid being dragged into each political or cultural debate. Sports are the best uniters of societies and culture — we can see this across American racial lines and South African racial lines as well as different religions groups in the Middle East and Asia. Maybe the 2026 World Cup, collectively hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, can solve all the border issues between the three countries. Even the most optimistic person is somewhat pessimistic about this outcome. But, if the games run smoothly, could Mexico accuse the U.S. of sportswashing, or vice versa? Lastly, it looks like Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, as it was the sole bidder). To call it sportswashing in 2034 will sound odd in a historic context — that would suggest bin Salman is genius for planning 11 years ahead on another cover-up. We could celebrate the 2034 World Cup like the IPL interest (and hopefully bid) as a demonstration of the quick economic growth and elevation of Saudi Arabia to the global stage. That does not have to be a bad thing for other countries, or a threat to them.",top,united states of america,0.39925373134328357,1608,54,29.77777777777778,57.678
80,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679

She posted a statement of her own shortly after Danny's, according to , where she requested ""privacy"" in ""this fragile time"". Hitting back, she wrote: ""I'm not sure why Daniel needs to tell instagram of his relationship status. I don't wish for the invasion. Could I ask for some privacy, while navigating through this fragile time."" Victoria has since deleted her post.

82,22:03:00,Hamas supporter in Mississauga states he doesn’t stand for all Canadian veterans at 'Remembrance Day' vigil,http://www.rebelnews.com/hamas_supporter_in_mississauga_states_that_he_doesn_t_stand_for_all_canadian_veterans_who_died_at_a_vigil_for_remembrance,"On Remembrance Day, November 11, there were two concurrent ceremonies in Mississauga, Ontario: one to honour Canadian veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice, and another to commemorate Palestinian martyrs at Celebration Square. Firas Al Nijim claimed it was for both but forgot to wear a poppy. He went on to express strong opinions about 'Zionists' and how they are slandering the 'resistance' terrorists of Hamas through the government and media. The poster received significant criticism on social media because the group used a desecrated version of the poppy with the colors of the Palestinian flag and referred to the gathering as a “Remembrance Day Vigil for Palestinian Martyrs.” “Canada is lost. Nothing is sacred to terrorists. Nothing,” said Tracey Wilson, a gun rights advocate with family in the Canadian military. ""NO! Just NO! Leave the poppy alone! This is Canada!"" Kat Kanada, a freedom activist, posted on X (formerly known as Twitter). An American author, mathematician, and anti-communist activist also criticized the post, saying, “Colonizer gonna colonize.” The poppy is a visual pledge of remembrance for the sacrifices of soldiers during the First World War, popularized by the poem “ In Flanders Fields ” by Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. He eloquently described how poppies grew 'row by row' over the graves of Canadian soldiers, marked by crosses. When asked about the raging hypocrisy and hijacking of the sacred icon and why he wasn’t wearing one himself, he claimed to have just forgotten it with the rush of setting up the event. Among the several dozen present in the crowd, there was no one spotted wearing a poppy. He noted that they only stood for the 'peacekeepers' because Canada had fallen into a 'trap,' as he called it, and had followed so-called 'US Imperialism.' He claimed that our armed forces who had participated 'died in an unjust way' and implied that they weren't worthy of being remembered. “Canadian veterans that are specifically the ones that died in peacekeeping operations, and projects like that. The ones that are misled, taken into a war that was not just, no, we don’t stand with them. At the same time we’re upset they were misled and fell in that trap.” The disgraceful comments from Firas Al Nijim disparaging the brave soldiers that died during the First and Second World Wars is not new from the anti-Israel crowd who demonstrate throughout the country. “The disrespect is so brazen. Why are these people here if they hate this country so much?” Harrison Faulkner, True North host of Ratio’d , opined on X. Nijim continued with a rant calling out the ‘Zionists’ who slander the ‘resistance fighters’ of Palestine, Hamas: Most shockingly of all, he claims that the allegedly peaceful ‘pro-Palestine’ demonstrators that gathered on Friday, November 10 at Celebration Square, Mississauga, think that Hamas is not a terrorist group, and he says most agree with that statement. “We asked the people here if they think that Hamas is a terrorist organization, they said no, the majority of people said here, they didn’t accept that, they thought that was wrong and that they’re legitimate.” At the same location of this rally, just meters away, Rebel News Mission Specialist David Menzies was interrupted by Essra Karam, who stated that the October 7 massacre of Israelis was 'justified' and had no problem praising them. Firas Al Nijim mentioned earlier that he was the man who joined in the boycott of Jewish owned Cafe Landwer. In a video posted on X, he can be seen returning drinks to anti-Israel protesters who purchased them 'by accident' and referring to the cashier that he wouldn't let them keep the drinks because ""it's like drinking blood."" Rebel News Commander Ezra Levant commented on the antisemitic act, stating, ""He must realize how foolish he looks and sounds... it has nothing to do with Israel.' Levant was referring to the fact that the cafe is simply named after its Jewish founder over 100 years ago in Berlin and has no connection to the Jewish state.""

83,16:00:17,Israelis killed on Oct 7 denied Jewish burials due to halachic status,https://www.jpost.com/judaism/article-773068,"Alina Palhati, 21, a Russian-Israeli woman who was murdered by Hamas at the Supernova music festival on October 7, was buried ""outside the fence"" of the cemetery in Beit She’an, because at the time of her death, she had not yet completed the process of converting to Judaism, and as such was not considered eligible for burial. The incident came to light on Monday during a Knesset discussion about expediting the conversion process for those currently serving in the IDF. “Alina was murdered as a Jew,” Palhati’s mother Olga said at the hearing, her voice choking up. “In the obituary notice, they didn't write that we were sitting the shiva mourning period, they said that we were receiving guests."" Oded Forer, who chairs the Knesset’s Aliyah, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs Committee, responded that he was “ashamed on behalf of the State of Israel that you were treated this way.” He called Palhati’s treatment “the greatest insult to someone who sanctified the land of Israel with their blood, who left their place in exile to come here. I want to be buried next to such a person,” he declared, “even if it means being buried outside the fence.” The committee also discussed the case of the Kapshiter family of four, who were all killed by Hamas terrorists on October 7 while on their way home from Ashkelon to Beersheba. Yania (Yevgeni) Kapshiter, killed alongside his wife, Dina, and two children, Aline, 8, and Eitan, 5, was denied a Jewish burial in the Dimona cemetery, and so he, like Palhati, was buried ""outside the fence."" The surviving family members, the children’s grandparents, decided to bury the entire family together ""outside the fence,"" even though the others were entitled to be buried inside the cemetery itself. The politicians and religious authorities at the hearing reacted to the stories with shock. Yesh Atid MK Elazar Stern said he “apologize[d] on behalf of all Judaism,” saying “This is not the Judaism we are a part of. Not our children’s, not our grandchildren’s [and] not my Judaism.” Rabbi Haim Amsalem, a former Shas MK, said the treatment of these families bordered on criminal. “There is no description,” he said, “that can capture this very wrong thing.” Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weiss, who sits on the rabbinate’s committee for honoring the dead, said he would propose a special representative to find solutions to problems like these, “so that there will not be a great trouble like this.” He added that “they did not distinguish between Jews and non-Jews in the brutal attack. We can do everything in line with Jewish law.” Forer said that “such damage to even one family is severe,” and asked “that this be the instruction that comes down from the chief rabbi to every rabbi: expect difficult cases. Jewish law knows how to solve problems.” Rabbi Edo Pachter, who accompanied Olga Palhati to the committee, said that in his opinion the rabbinate should apologize to Palhati. Rabbi Chaim Weisberg, chief rabbi of the IDF, said the situations discussed in the hearing did not occur within the IDF. “We fight together and are buried together,” he said. “There is no burial ‘outside the fence.’ Yisrael Beytenu MK Yulia Malinovsky said that there are now 7,000 soldiers in the IDF who are not Jewish according to Halacha. “The mere fact that a person has enlisted in the IDF,” Malinovsky said, “is Judaism in my eyes. He is ready to die for the sake of the country.” Malinovsky told IDF representatives not to wait for soldiers to ask for a conversion, but rather to present a solution to the problem themselves. “You can arrange wedding canopies in army camps,” she said, “this is all a question of will.” ""If on the subject of conversion and burial, you won't change the limits,"" she said, ""the people will blow up the limits for you. Today, we're asking you. In the future, we will demand it."" Malinovsky connected the issue to a broader notion of what must be rethought in the aftermath of the massacre. “What happened on October 7 was not only the collapse of the security ‘conception,’” she said, referring to a blindspot among the authorities, “but also the halachic one. If we do not address this, after everything is over, we will fall apart from the inside. If you want to be part of the nation and the country,” she said, “you must not remain in the old ‘conceptions.’” Porer summarized the discussion similarly. “There is ‘before Simchat Torah,’” he said, referring to the October 7 attack, “and there is ‘after,’ as far as the people of Israel are concerned. Let it be clear,” he said, “that those who have chosen to bind their fate with the Jewish people, those who are here in the country to fight for our right to live here, my demand is to go towards him.” ",top,israel,0.3761105626850938,1013,39,25.974358974358974,70.139

85,11:26:04,WWE match ‘called off’ after another devastating kick to head,https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/14/wwe-match-called-off-another-devastating-kick-head-19819334/,"WWE superstar Xia Li continued her reign of terror over Monday Night Raw this week with another devastating kick. The 35-year-old Chinese wrestler has been rejuvenated in recent weeks, having previously taken out Candice LeRae last month, forcing their match to be halted by the referee. This week, she repeated the feat with Candice at ringside as Xia took on Indi Hartwell in singles action, with the latter looking for a measure of revenge for her tag team partner. Partway through the bout, Xia rocked her opponent with her signature spinning kick, rocking her as Indi appeared dazed and staggered around before dropping to her feet. She went to go on the attack but the referee intervened and cancelled the match, calling it off and awarding the win to the dominating star, who has been rejuvenated recently. Just last week, she laid out Becky Lynch with that same strike as The Man was making her way to the ring for the Battle Royal which was to determine Rhea Ripley’s number one contender for the Women’s World Championship. Thanks to Xia, Becky was unable to compete in the match – which was won by Zoey Stark – and she returned on Monday night looking for revenge. She came out to confront her rival, who tried to cheap shot her as she got into the ring, before making a strategic choice to roll out and wait to fight another day. The feud between the two stars is already picking up steam, and it marks a real rise for Xia after she has previously struggled to find her feet on Raw or SmackDown. Before beating Candice on October 30, she had largely been seen losing match on WWE’s streaming show Main Event going back to early June. She had rarely appeared on SmackDown either, and lost whenever she did ever since beating Natalya in February 2022 in her televised debut for the blue brand.

As the Israel-Hamas conflict intensifies, the delay raises concerns, especially with antisemitic incidents in Victoria skyrocketing by 1000%. Despite a budgeted allocation, the funding, aimed at raising awareness, implementing educational programs, and enhancing data collection, has not materialised. The Jewish Community Council of Victoria President, Daniel Aghion, emphasised the urgency of support, stating: With a surge in antisemitic incidents following recent events in the Middle East, an additional 60 police officers have been deployed to reassure Jewish communities in St Kilda, Caulfield, and Balaclava. Community leaders, including Yossi Goldfarb from Zionism Victoria, express anticipation for a positive outcome but stress the community's unease amid the current spike in antisemitism. The Community Security Group (CSG), slated to receive $900,000, is also awaiting its funds.

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "". Whereas another says, ""It has to be possible to feel the pain in one community without denying it in another"". ""Exciting news!

The pair concluded their maintenance work outside the International Space Station (ISS) in six hours and 42 minutes, according to the space agency. The spacewalk on Nov. 1 saw Moghbeli and O’Hara complete works on the station’s solar arrays, which track the sun, but they ran out of time to remove and stow a communications electronics box. Leaving this task for a future spacewalk, the pair instead conducted an assessment of how the job could be done. During the hours-long mission, a tool bag gave them the slip and was “lost,” NASA said, with flight controllers spotting it using the ISS’ external cameras. Fortunately, the tools were not required for the remainder of their tasks. “Mission Control analyzed the bag’s trajectory and determined that risk of recontacting the station is low and that the onboard crew and space station are safe with no action required,” NASA said on its official blog . According to EarthSky, a website tracking cosmic events, the tool bag is currently orbiting Earth ahead of the ISS, and can potentially be spotted from Earth with a pair of binoculars during the next few months until it disintegrates in our planet’s atmosphere. This isn’t the first time an astronaut has lost tools in space. In 2008, Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper’s bag floated away while she was cleaning and lubricating gears on a malfunctioning rotary joint. A 2006 spacewalk saw astronauts Piers Sellers and Michael Fossum lose a 14-inch spatula while testing a method of repairing the space shuttle. Space debris or junk, like these objects, are artificial materials that orbit Earth but are no longer functional. They can be anything from a small chip of paint to parts discarded during rocket launches. In September 2023, the European Space Agency estimated 35,290 objects were being tracked and cataloged by the various space surveillance networks, with the total mass of objects orbiting Earth amounting to more than 11,000 tons.

A British military cargo plane made five trips from Pakistan to Cyprus and Romania, delivering the arms. Agencies Representative Image Cash-strapped Pakistan reportedly earned USD 364 million in an arms deal with two private US companies last year to supply ammunition to Ukraine in its war with Russia, according to a media report. A British military cargo plane flew from Pakistan Air Force Base Nur Khan in Rawalpindi to the British military base in Cyprus, Akrotiri, and then to Romania a total of five times to supply arms to the war-torn country, the BBC Urdu reported on Monday. Islamabad has, however, consistently denied that it has provided any ammunition to Ukraine, a neighbouring country to Romania. Citing details of the contract from the American Federal Procurement Data System, the BBC report claimed that Pakistan signed two contracts with American companies named ""Global Military"" and ""Northrop Grumman"" for the sale of 155mm shells. These agreements to provide weapons to Ukraine were signed on August 17, 2022, and were specifically linked to the purchase of 155mm shells. The Foreign Office in Islamabad has denied any sale of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, saying that Pakistan maintained a policy of ""strict neutrality"" in the dispute between the two countries and did not provide them with any arms or ammunition in that context. These alleged agreements took place during the rule of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) - a multi-party coalition that ousted Imran Khan-led government through a no-trust vote in April last year. Then Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had pledged to take Pakistan-UK relations to a ""new height"", retired in November 2022. In August 2022, when these alleged contracts were signed, the Ukraine crisis was very much a part of the political discourse in Pakistan, particularly in the wake of the cricketer-turned-politician Khan's visit to Russia on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine. Months after the visit, Gen Bajwa publicly distanced from Khan and called for the invasion to be stopped immediately. During a visit to Pakistan this July, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also rejected reports that Pakistan was supplying arms to Ukraine to support its military during the ongoing conflict with Russia. The BBC Urdu report claimed that a USD 232 million contract was awarded to Global Military while another USD 131 million contract was signed with Northrop Grumman. ""These agreements expired last month i.e. October 2023,"" it added. The report alleged that the deliveries were made in a British military cargo plane from the Nur Khan Air Base, which landed in Rawalpindi five times. The first such plane landed in Rawalpindi in August 2022. ""Each time, the plane flew from Nur Khan Airbase to the British military base in Cyprus and then to Romania, that too at a time when Russia was waging war in Romania's neighbouring country Ukraine,"" the report claimed. BBC Urdu, while citing further evidence for its claims, said data by the State Bank of Pakistan also showed that the country's arms exports increased by 3,000 per cent during FY 2022-23. ""Pakistan exported arms worth USD 13 million in 2021-22, while these exports reached USD 415 million in 2022-23,"" it said. Earlier reports said secret Pakistani arms sales to the US to be used by Ukraine helped cash-strapped Islamabad secure a crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout earlier this year. The arms sales were made for the purpose of supplying the Ukrainian military - marking Pakistani involvement in a conflict it had faced US pressure to take sides on. Pakistan's Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, rejected as ""baseless and fabricated"" the report which says the cash-strapped country provided arms to the US to get its support to clinch the USD 3 billion deal with the IMF towards the end of June to avoid default.

""These are mainly tags and insults, but there are also assaults and injuries"", Darmanin added. Those acts resulted in 571 arrests, the ministry told AFP. In late October, Paris prosecutors opened an investigation into an incident when dozens of Stars of David were daubed on buildings around the city and its suburbs. France has accused Russia of interfering in its affairs by sharing photos online of the anti-Semitic graffiti. Darmanin said there had also been anti-Muslim incidents ""but they are not on the scale of what we are seeing in terms of anti-Semitism"". He said that some mosques had received threats of violence.

The really really big challenge that we all face is to go beyond what our minds think are the limits of love and what love really is."" Victoria continued her heartfelt message by saying: ""A lot of the time that thing we call love can more accurately be described as attachment or desire or need or longing or closeness or connection. And all of these are totally valuable and human and we need to acknowledge and appreciate and accept every part of our experience."" ""But sometimes when you love very deeply you will find yourself facing terrifying fears of loss that can feel so big and devastating that you don't know how you can survive them and you can't imagine life without this person that you love. It's in these moments when you are staring into the abyss that you have an opportunity to expand your consciousness beyond the limitations of your mind. ""You have an opportunity to discover more of who you really are and more of who your soul really is and more of your connection with this person who you love,"" she wrote.

""Fear is an unknown place and this is what makes it so frightening, we makeup stories about what is beyond the fear and they are not happy stories. But we can choose to stay present with everything that unfolds and to feel as much as possible in every moment and we can be surprised that there are more moments of beauty and grace and even joy than we ever imagined.""

The centre said deepfake videos and “hyper-realistic bots” would make the spread of disinformation during a campaign easier.(Freepik) The National Cyber Security Centre said “this year has seen the emergence of state-aligned actors as a new cyber threat to critical national infrastructure” such as power, water and internet networks. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. The centre — part of Britain's cyberespionage agency, GCHQ — said in its annual review that the past year also has seen “the emergence of a new class of cyber adversary in the form of state-aligned actors, who are often sympathetic to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine and are ideologically, rather than financially, motivated.” It said states and state-aligned groups pose “an enduring and significant threat,” from Russian-language criminals targeting British firms with ransomware attacks, to “China state-affiliated cyber actors” using their skills to pursue “strategic objectives which threaten the security and stability of U.K. interests.” Echoing warnings by Britain's MI5 and MI6 intelligence agencies, the centre called the rise of China as a tech superpower “an epoch-defining challenge for UK security.” “We risk China becoming the predominant power in cyberspace if our efforts to raise resilience and develop our capabilities do not keep pace,” it said. The report also highlighted the threat posed by fast-evolving AI technology to elections, including a UK national election due to be held by January 2025. While Britain's old-fashioned method of voting, with pencil and paper, makes it hard for hackers to disrupt the vote itself, the centre said deepfake videos and “hyper-realistic bots” would make the spread of disinformation during a campaign easier.

[NEWS1] The president of the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday stressed the need to enhance cooperation and complementarity to prevent atrocities, calling for more states to join and provide justice, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. “Unfortunately, the Asia-Pacific [APAC] region has the lowest participation,” Judge Piotr Hofmanski, the President of the ICC, said during his welcoming remarks at the two-day high-level regional seminar at Lotte Hotel Seoul in downtown Seoul. Only 19 countries out of 123 state parties of the ICC are from the APAC region. The Korean government and the ICC on Tuesday co-hosted a two-day high-level regional seminar in downtown Seoul to discuss the “past, present, and future of the Rome Statute” with high-level ministerial, judicial, and technical representatives from the APAC region. The Rome Statute, adopted by the United Nations in 1998, was the foundation of establishing the ICC. Silvia Fernandez de Gurmendi, the President of the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute, echoed the need for expanding the court’s universality while expressing deep appreciation for Korea taking part. Korea ratified the Rome Statute in 2002. “The intimate cooperation of the international society, along with the ICC, is essential to respond to crimes against humanity and protect people’s lives and rights,” Justice Minister Han Dong-hoon said during his opening remarks. Attended by government officials and regional experts in different countries, including Japan and Cambodia, participants are expected to discuss ways to enhance cooperation and complementarity of the Roman Statute system and to promote universal ratification amongst state parties. The ICC was established as the first permanent international tribunal adopting the Roman Statute to criminally prosecute individuals who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression and war. It exercises its jurisdiction over individuals who have committed such crimes in or from 123 states that have ratified the international treaty, accounting for around two-thirds of states, according to ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah. Some major countries, including the United States and China, have not ratified their statutes and so are not under the jurisdiction of the ICC. The general rule is that the ICC cannot intervene if crimes occur in nonstate parties or are committed by citizens of non-parties. The only exception is when the UN Security Council refers cases to the ICC, which has happened only twice, including a case regarding hostilities in Sudan’s Darfur region. The court has launched an investigation into 17 cases. The court is also known for having issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin in March for allegedly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia unlawfully. According to the court on Tuesday, the historic decision was not made for political reasons but because there was reasonable evidence of crimes against children.

95,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679
96,15:35:00,Bestselling spiritual author Marianne Williamson presses on with against-the-odds presidential run,https://www.startribune.com/bestselling-spiritual-author-marianne-williamson-presses-on-with-against-the-odds-presidential-run/600319153/,"Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming for months across America — to audiences large and small, from churches and colleges to spiritual centers and soup kitchens — in a demanding schedule of appearances in her second tenacious, against-the-odds run for the presidency. The bestselling spiritual author and one-time advisor to Oprah Winfrey didn't make it to the 2020 primaries in a wide-open Democratic field. Now she is running against a sitting president from her own party, and the Democratic establishment has closed ranks behind Joe Biden. Even some of her most devoted followers doubt she can be elected. So why is Williamson even running? She says it's the faith she has in herself and the American people. ''The most important things you do in life, not because there's guaranteed success on some external level, but because you feel in your heart it's the right thing to do,'' Williamson, 71, said during an interview in New York City. She admits it has been grueling at times — not just the punishing campaign schedule, but more so the emotional bruising from a barrage of unflattering characterizations. For her, it's ''the ultimate challenge to have tough skin, but a soft and open heart,'' she said. But Williamson worries that negative perceptions detract from her policy positions, which include financial reparations for Black Americans and creation of a Department of Peace. ''What are the words they use? Wacky, kooky, crystal lady,'' she said, listing the names she's called. ''People will take one line out of a book, completely out of context. That has certainly been done to me. Plus, you know, they lie.'' Born in Houston to a Jewish family, Judaism remains her core belief, and she also embraces universal spiritual themes, like loving one another. Williamson came into the spotlight with her popular 1992 book, ''A Return to Love.'' Oprah, highlighting it on her own site, wrote: ''I have never been more moved by a book.'' Williamson, the author of more than a dozen titles and well-known for supporting LGBTQ people, retains a legion of dedicated fans. Millions buy her books, attend her lectures and engage with her on TikTok. ''She is extremely sincere in her beliefs, wise in many ways even,'' said Issac Bailey, a communications professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who has written about Williamson's faith and politics. ''But she also has a streak that takes her beyond the pale.'' He pointed to her wariness and sharp criticism of government vaccine mandates that came up during her last campaign. She later said she supports vaccines. ''I'm a socially middle of the road Jew who goes to the doctor,'' she said. ''I'm not a crystal lady. I understand how important science is.'' Williamson entered politics with an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014, then broke onto the national stage two years later as a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders' failed presidential bid. In 2020, she entered the race herself. She acknowledges making what she calls ''cringeworthy'' comments back then, like how she would harness love to defeat former President Donald Trump. ''Once they could be contextualized in a way that made me appear silly, there was almost no getting past the mockery,'' she said. People may embrace quasi-spiritual language in their private lives, but if it's from political candidates, it typically doesn't play well on the campaign trail, said Galen Watts, a sociology and legal studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But this is not new territory for Williamson. For years, she has been under fire from intellectuals who call her theology too shallow, from politicians who mock her ideas, and more recently from some former campaign staff who say she's irascible and is only trying to sell more books. She concedes that she probably swore more than she should have in her last campaign, but scoffs at the book-selling gibe. ''The way to sell books is by going on a book tour, not a presidential campaign,"" she said. ''The way to sell books in my field is to never mention politics.'' Some have questioned her political inexperience. But she dismisses that: ''I reject the notion that only those whose careers have been ensconced in the car that drove us into this ditch are the only people we should consider qualified to drive us out of the ditch.'' She announced her candidacy in February, and now is arguably the best-known Democrat still challenging Biden for the party's 2024 presidential nomination. But recent polls show her running more than 60 percentage points behind. She is well-liked by many young people, including Jose Serna, a 21-year-old at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Serna hopes she stays in the race ''because she is illuminating the ideas that young people care about'' including Medicare for all, equitable wages and affordable housing. ''While I do believe that it is unlikely that Marianne will win the nomination, it is not because of her policies,'' he said, citing a common complaint by Williamson and her backers about a lack of media attention. Marie Griffith, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, says there's a practical reason why Williamson stands no chance of winning. ''She has no connection that I know of to Democratic machine politics — meaning the people who raise all the money and make or break the political careers of those identifying as Democrats,'' Griffith said. Williamson talks at times in religious and spiritual terms to describe America as a nation in need of confession and atonement. She worries about vast economic inequality and wants to declare a climate emergency. One of her signature policy proposals would have the government pay Black citizens reparations for centuries of enslavement and discrimination. She advocated for this in her 1997 book ''The Healing of America.'' Today, she proposes creating a council of Black academic, cultural and political leaders to disperse at least $1 trillion to Black Americans over two decades. Author and rabbi Jay Michaelson lauded Williamson for raising the issue before other political candidates, and for her work during the AIDS crisis, but in 2019 he wrote a scathing critique of her bid for president. He called her ''selfish, deluded and dumb by denigrating science'' and said she gives spiritually a bad name. Michaelson, in a recent interview, said he agreed with Williamson ''that our spiritual commitments and our religious commitments should impact our political lives.'' But he says she will remain a fringe candidate because some of her policy positions are too radical for many. ""To say, 'We need a politics of love' without explaining what that is,'' he said. ''Or that we need a new paradigm, or that we need some kind of revolution — that doesn't play on Main Street.'' Williamson denies denigrating science and disputes broader criticisms of her campaign. ''This idea that I am unserious — my campaign is the one talking about one in four Americans living with medical debt. My campaign is the one talking about the fact that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,'' she said. ''My campaign is the most serious campaign.'' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

100,12:00:00,Saudi Arabia wants the Indian Premier League: Why is there no discussion of 'sportswashing'?,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4306629-saudi-arabia-wants-the-indian-premier-league-why-is-there-no-discussion-of-sportswashing/,"Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman previously said he does not care about allegations of “sportswashing” against his country, and that he would continue investing in sports if it adds to his country’s gross domestic product. Saudi Arabia’s recent expression of interest in buying a $5 billion stake in cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL), with a plan to place the IPL in a holding company worth up to $30 billion, only reinforces bin Salman’s seriousness about investing in sports. Saudi officials reportedly see an opportunity to massively expand the league presence internationally, including within the kingdom, similar to the English Premier League or the European Champions League Allegations of “sportswashing,” in this situation — of using sports to burnish a nation’s dodgy reputation — haven’t been aggressively levelled against the kingdom, a stark contrast to the or the contracts for , who both now play for Saudi football teams. The rather quiet response from western politicians is telling of several things as they relate to Saudi Arabia on the global stage. First, sportswashing can be a lazy rebuttal to the kingdom’s investment in sports and, in general, the Middle East. The definition of “sportswashing,” which is the practice of using sports to improve reputation, can be rather expansive in practice. Yes, we can all agree Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup to elevate the reputation of the country. So did Brazil with the 2016 Summer Olympics and South Africa with the 2010 World Cup and so will countries in the future. Saudi officials clearly know that sports can bring good attention to a country. (The Ministry of Culture has from NBA great Lebron James’s visit during September this year…yes Lebron James was in Saudi Arabia.) That said, it is not the sole reason for investing in sports, but it is obviously low-hanging fruit for politicians, because it will always contain some truth. Saudi Arabia is moving at a fast pace to change the country, and it has deep pockets to do so. Critics will note that women weren’t allowed to vote until 2011 and could not independently access health care and education without male supervision until 2017. Women also could not drive until 2018. For context, bin Salman began his rise to power in 2013, when he was named head of the Crown Prince’s Court with the rank of minister. He would be named crown prince in June 2017, when King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud deposed Muhammad bin Nayef. Since bin Salman has become crown prince, the country has hosted major boxing matches (such Anthony Joshua versus Andy Ruiz in 2019), launched LIV Golf in 2021 (which by 2023 was merged with the PGA tour) and took over Newcastle United in 2021. Additionally, Saudi football club Al-Nassr welcomed Ronaldo to the team at the start of this year, and, last month Riyadh was host to a boxing match between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou (with stars such as Kanye West and Mike Tyson in attendance) as a kickoff to Riyadh Season, which is a major festival where the city will host a series of huge shows and spectacles alongside a series of sporting events. Most of the Saudi sovereign deals have been executed via the country’s Public Investment Fund, which has reportedly made overtures in recent years to buy the WWE and Formula One. An investment in the IPL by the Public Investment Fund (or another entity) would fit well with the Saudis’ other sports investments — the IPL, for example, received sponsor bids up $6.2 billion for the right to broadcast games through 2027, which equates roughly to $15 million per match in a sport where the season lasts eight weeks. The per-match number is more than the English Premier League and slightly behind the $17 million per game for the National Football League in the U.S. Let’s also not forget that the kingdom has a significant Indian population between 10 and 12 percent who will be happy to have more access to IPL games. The push by Saudi Arabia (and other non-Western countries) into sports is fueling a “West versus everyone else” type of narrative. The quiet response to the reported offer for IPL versus the stir caused by LIV Golf (in competition with the PGA) suggests two different responses for deals done in the East versus deals done in the West. The PGA is sacred in the U.S. The IPL is unknown to Americans, so there are no political points to be gained by pushing back against this deal. However, the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, has also surprisingly faced little pushback for its estimated $200 million investment in Leonsis’s Monumental Sports, which controls the NBA’s Washington Wizards, the NHL’s Washington Capitals and the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. Qatar’s is the first sovereign fund to purchase a stake in a team in the top four U.S. sports leagues. (MLS club New York City FC is majority-controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi.) Skeptics will say Qatar is becoming an important ally to the U.S., so there is little political upside to criticizing this deal. (For example, Qatar is the go-between with Hamas for Israel and the U.S.) Countries accused of sportswashing are largely non-western countries, such as Qatar with the 2022 World Cup and China with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Was the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics an example of sportswashing? Or, how do we distinguish between the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in this conversation? Are both examples of sportswashing, or only the 2022 games? Historians can reference the 1934 World Cup in Mussolini’s Italy and the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, but that retroactive application of sportswashing ignores how little the language of sportswashing was used before the 2000s (or even 2010s). One can even argue that Hitler hosted the Olympics in 1936 to prove the superiority of the “pure German” race over any other race, only to have black American athlete Jesse Owens star in the games. Eighteen black athletes would participate in those 1936 games (and elevate the prominence of the U.S.) only to be forgotten and dismissed upon their return home to the U.S. That time in history was more about proving superiority of countries and races than it was about sportswashing. Regardless, Saudi Arabia is not Nazi Germany or Mussolini’s Italy and nor does not have the U.S. 1936 racial issues. Furthermore, the West as the arbitrator of who is sportswashing based on human rights has generally permitted those best allied to the West to escape criticism more than those less allied to the U.S. This positioning of countries on a theoretical human rights spectrum obfuscates the conversation on sportswashing by masking over the behaviors of certain countries versus others to maintain Western moral superiority. The discussion in this fashion also muddies the waters by ignoring any complicity of other countries in alleged human rights violations. Indeed, it may be better to ask why we should care if any country is sportswashing. Individuals and countries can boycott “problem” countries by avoiding travel to those countries, not participating in certain games or sports in those countries, or cutting aid and investment within those countries, if they feel obliged to do so. Sports organizers and leaders, for their part, may simply want to avoid being dragged into each political or cultural debate. Sports are the best uniters of societies and culture — we can see this across American racial lines and South African racial lines as well as different religions groups in the Middle East and Asia. Maybe the 2026 World Cup, collectively hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, can solve all the border issues between the three countries. Even the most optimistic person is somewhat pessimistic about this outcome. But, if the games run smoothly, could Mexico accuse the U.S. of sportswashing, or vice versa? Lastly, it looks like Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, as it was the sole bidder). To call it sportswashing in 2034 will sound odd in a historic context — that would suggest bin Salman is genius for planning 11 years ahead on another cover-up. We could celebrate the 2034 World Cup like the IPL interest (and hopefully bid) as a demonstration of the quick economic growth and elevation of Saudi Arabia to the global stage. That does not have to be a bad thing for other countries, or a threat to them.",top,united states of america,0.39925373134328357,1608,54,29.77777777777778,57.678
101,08:30:43,Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/gaza-war-pushes-tumultuous-israel-turkey-ties-into-deep-freezer?traffic_source=rss,"The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly of Israel. Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments. “Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,” the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the , a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The vessel was trying to break Israel’s blockade and deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. It was the culmination of a sharp dive in ties since October 7. On October 20, Erdogan said Israel’s operations amounted to “genocide”. At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a “war criminal” over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas’s cross-border assault three weeks earlier. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital. But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints. By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. State-owned Turkish Airlines started direct flights to Israel in 1986. In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time. From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. Two defence agreements were signed in 1996, paving the way for a strategic military partnership that included the upgrading of F-4 and F-5 jet aircraft, M-60 tanks and helicopters. Turkey, Israel and the US participated in joint aerial and naval exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean until 2009. Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in 2002. Erdogan visited Tel Aviv as prime minister three years later, presenting himself as a possible mediator between Israelis and Palestinians. In 2004, Erdogan condemned Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as “state-sponsored terrorism”, reflecting wider Turkish support for Palestinians, and Hamas in particular. Yet, during high-level visits in 2006 and 2007, Turkey worked to resolve tensions between Syria and Israel over Syria’s involvement in Lebanon and support for Palestinian groups and Hezbollah. In 2007, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul offered to help secure the release of three captured soldiers: Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas from 2006 to 2011, and Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev who were both held by Hezbollah from 2006 until their bodies were returned to Israel in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres at the time thanked Turkey, as well as Egypt and Germany, for helping release Shalit. The three-week war on Gaza in 2008-2009 reinforced tensions between Turkey and Israel. The assault on the Turkish aid ship Mavi Marmara led to a diplomatic falling-out, which saw Ankara expel the Israeli ambassador. Official ties remained frosty until 2016 when the two countries agreed to a compensation deal and a pathway to normalising relations. But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite rekindled diplomatic tensions, business between Turkey and Israel continued to boom. Between 2010, the year of the Mavi Marmara incident, and 2021, trade volume more than doubled from $3.4bn to $8.4bn. Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last year, Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara and ambassadors were appointed in both capitals. Erdogan met Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in September and they both pledged greater cooperation between their countries. The horrors of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Erdogan’s hardening rhetoric, however, appear to have stalled those plans. Last month, he cancelled any . Early in the current war, Erdogan spoke to multiple world leaders and between Hamas and Israel. That suggestion, said Piccoli of Teneo, appeared to have evaporated in recent days.",top,united states of america,0.4310487200660611,1211,47,25.76595744680851,44.712
102,13:07:49,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

A look at the window cleaner company owner as he splits from Loose Women star after 33 years of marriage By Carolina Piras For Mailonline Published: 08:08 EST, 14 November 2023 | Updated: 08:57 EST, 14 November 2023 e-mail View comments Linda Robson officially confirmed her split from Mark Dunford this week following 33 years of marriage. The Loose Women star, 65, shared the news to Woman magazine this week as she admitted 'enough is enough'. The ex-couple share children Louis, 31, and Roberta, 27, and faced testing times in the latest years, leading them to the brink of divorce already in 2017. While they overcame their past hurdles, the latest marital woes proved to be too much and they have called it a day. Now, MailOnline reveals what you need to know about Mark Dunford. Parting ways: Linda Robson, 65, has officially confirmed her split from Mark Dunford, 63, following 33 years of marriage Tough: The ex-couple share children Louis, 31, and Roberta, 27, and faced testing times in the latest years (pictured at their wedding in 1990 with Pauline Quirke, right) What does Linda Robson's estranged husband Mark Dunford do for a living? Mark spent much of his life working as a window cleaner and now owns his own company in the business. How did Linda Robson and Mark Dunford meet? As youngsters, Linda and Mark near each other in Islington - where Linda has lived her whole life - and their parents were friends. Speaking on Loose Women in 2017, Linda revealed she used to babysit Mark when they were kids, as they knew each other from a really young age. As she discussed the role of fate in her life, the Bird Of A Feather star explained he was just a child at the time, and therefore there was no chemistry yet. ‘I used to babysit for Mark – he was a couple of years younger than me,’ she recalled. ‘He was just two and a half years younger than me! I was 16 and he was 13 and a half, and he was a bit of a pain in the butt, to be honest. And we lived in the street next to each other.’ The star firmly believed it was fate which brought Mark to her - after she and her three-year-old bumped into him while walking in a local park years later. During the unexpected encounter, Linda revealed her daughter asked Mark if he could give them a lift home. ‘And then he gives us a lift home and then he asked me out on a date. So that was fate that day because I’d known him all my life and I’d never seen him in that way before,' she added. After that, Mark asked Linda out but she revealed she wasn't sure if that was a proper date or not, and the duo went to a local Italian restaurant. How they met: Linda and Mark near each other in Islington - where Linda has lived her whole life - and Linda used to babysit him (pictured in 2015) Why did Linda Robson and Mark Dunford split? Linda and Mark - who married in 1990 - live together in London but it was claimed recently that they have been having relationship difficulties . She confirmed the split this week, telling Woman magazine: 'He's a really good dad and we had some good years, but enough is enough. 'I've got my family and my kids around me. And I'm going on a cruise with Lesley Joseph in November. I'm keeping busy. I feel fine. I'm just going away on trips all the time. 'I'm not interested [in dating] honestly. I can't be a***d with all that.' The TV personality previously revealed their troubles started when children Lauren and Louis were each subjected to traumatic events, which deeply tested their marriage. Things became testing when Lauren was diagnosed with bulimia and Louis with PTSD after he witnessed the murder of his friend. 'People always said [Lauren] looked like Kate Moss,' she said, first speaking of her daughter's ordeal. 'We went to the agency and they took loads of photographs but somebody said to her, ""You need to lose a little bit of weight"". 'I replied, ""No, she doesn’t"" and we walked out. It was ridiculous.' It was after this incident that Linda noticed Lauren dropping weight, becoming dramatically thin, yet eating normally in front of her. She deduced it was down to being bulimic, vomiting up the food she had eaten, and took her to seek help. Lauren beat the condition after two years, when she was 19; but in 2008, more heartache ensued, when Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death.

Louis saw Ben die in the street which led to PTSD and frequent severe panic attacks. 'Louis is doing really well now. He’s really into his music and writing all the time,' Linda said of her eldest son, who has, 10 years later, come out the other side. Linda's marriage was also tested when she lost her father due to lung cancer in 1997. He was still a young man [57] and died a week after diagnosis. Her mother died in 2012, also from cancer, this time stomach, age 75, which Linda admits was traumatic but that she died peacefully and pain-free. A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Linda has been quite open behind the scenes about problems in her marriage. 'They hit a bit of a rough patch before Christmas but they've managed to work through it. 'Linda turned to her family and close friends who supported her through it all.' While Linda denied she was in the midst of a 'marriage crisis' she admitted that it hasn't been plain sailing with her long-term love. When asked about the crisis by The Sun she stated: 'That's a load of rubbish. 'We're still living together. We both love our kids more than anything else in the world, obviously you have a few hiccups in every marriage. 'We've been married 33 years so it's not going to be all plain sailing, but we're still together at the moment.' The actress recently spoke about going through 'ups and downs' in her relationship. She told Best magazine: 'There have been ups and downs, obviously, like any couple. What I think we have in common is that we love our kids more than anything. In June, the mother-of-three admitted she hasn't had sex with Mark for two years while the Loose Women panel discussed if taking a 'sex break' can help struggling relationships. Last year, Linda revealed she has never got undressed in front of her husband and goes into the bathroom to put on her pyjamas. The TV presenter discussed her private life in an October 2022 episode of Loose Women and admitted her Catholic upbringing influenced her views on nudity. Linda said: 'I find it quite difficult, I've never underdressed in front of my husband so when I put my pajamas on, I go in the bathroom. 'My kids have seen my undressed but not my husband or former partners because my mum was Irish Catholic.' Family: Linda and Mark share children Louis, 31, and Roberta, 27 (pictured: Linda with her daughters in 2011) Why did Linda Robson split from Tony Tyler? Prior to marrying Mark, Linda was in a relationship with Tony Tyler for 11 years. Linda met Tony when she was 17 and they had Lauren when she was 25 - however, their relationship was plagued with woes. She told the Loose Women audience in 2017: 'I caught my ex several times cheating on me — even when I was pregnant with Lauren. 'Once I was away and Lauren was away with me. When I got back, everything seemed fine in the flat. But when I went to go to bed that night, I moved the pillow and there was a tissue with lipstick on it, and long blonde hairs.' Linda said: 'I remember saying to my ex “what’s this?”, and he said “one of my friends stayed and her partner, it must be from her.” But you know when you know?’ She explained how she did her own detective work as she was determined to find out what was going on. Linda said: 'When I found out it was like a relief because you know then it’s over, you’re not going mad.' The star continued: 'I’d found letters, I followed him. I caught him with someone while I was pregnant with Lauren as well. I was waiting outside the house and he went into this girl’s house.'

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "". Whereas another says, ""It has to be possible to feel the pain in one community without denying it in another"". ""Exciting news!

109,12:01:27,US NSA warns of potential conflict in China-US relationship if not managed well,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/us-nsa-warns-of-potential-conflict-in-china-us-relationship-if-not-managed-well-23319845,"US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has cautioned that the relationship between the United States and has the potential to turn towards conflict if not handled well. This warning comes ahead of the anticipated summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sullivan emphasized the importance of effectively managing the complex and competitive nature of the relationship. ADVERTISEMENT The summit is expected to cover topics such as Taiwan, China's actions in the Indo-Pacific, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the war in , human rights, and trade disputes. Sullivan highlighted the need for open communication and responsible management of competition through intense diplomacy. The goal is not only to manage issues but also to achieve tangible results for both nations. Sullivan said the most important thing is that ""this is a complex and a competitive relationship that could easily veer into conflict or confrontation if it's not well managed"". ""So, managing the relationship effectively is the single most important responsibility of the president and everyone who works for him on this file,"" Sullivan told reporters at a news conference here. Taiwan is likely to be at the top of the list of topics China will be keen to discuss with Biden. Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island, which is set to hold elections early next year. China has held provocative military exercises around Taiwan in recent months to warn the island against taking any steps to declare independence. The Israel-Hamas war, the war in Ukraine, human rights and trade disputes are expected to be discussed during the Biden-Xi meeting. Bilateral relations plunged to a new low last August when Beijing cut off major communication channels with Washington in retaliation for a high-level US visit to Taiwan. Attempts to restore dialogue were derailed this February when a US fighter jet shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over American airspace. Since then, the US has spent months seeking to engage China, its biggest strategic rival, including dispatching four cabinet-level officials to Beijing in recent months. ""Those are some of the issues that, through intense diplomacy, we have been able to manage,"" Sullivan said. ""Then we will look for opportunities to actually generate affirmative outcomes that deliver tangible progress for the American people in areas where our interests overlap. I mentioned, for example, the issue of fentanyl. ""We're hoping to see some progress on that issue this coming week, and that could then open the door to further cooperation on other issues where we aren't just managing things, but we're actually delivering tangible results,"" Sullivan said. ""Beyond that, the US and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries, including issues in moments of crisis like the Russia-Ukraine crisis. President Biden has had a number of candid conversations with President Xi about the question of military support to the Russian Federation in the conduct of its war in Ukraine,"" he said in response to a question. During the San Francisco meeting, Sullivan said that he anticipates the leaders will discuss some of the most fundamental elements of the US-China bilateral relationship, including the continued importance of strengthening open lines of communication and managing competition responsibly. ""The way we achieve that is through intense diplomacy. That's how we clear up misperceptions and avoid surprises. That's how we work together where and when our interests overlap and deliver on key priorities for the American people,"" he said. Sullivan said in recent months he met the Chinese Foreign Minister and Director of the ruling Communist Party of China Central Foreign Affairs Commission Wang Yi thrice, and top US secretaries of State, Treasury, and Commerce all went to Beijing. ""China for its part sent its vice president, foreign minister and other senior officials to the United States in recent months. President Biden comes into this summit on a solid footing, given the ways in which he has positioned the United States to be able to compete effectively both at home and around the world,"" Sullivan said. Responding to questions, he talked about having lines of communication open to manage competition responsibly. ""That's what the (US) president has set out to achieve in this summit with President Xi. He sees this not just as a one-off meeting, but as an important moment to be able to establish the kind of basis upon which we can proceed out into the future,"" Sullivan added. In Beijing, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the two presidents will have in-depth communication on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance in shaping China-US relations and major issues concerning world peace and development. ""China does not fear competition, but we do not agree that China-US relations should be defined by competition,"" Mao said. The US needs to respect China's concerns and legitimate right to development, rather than emphasising its own concerns at the expense of China's interests,"" she said on Monday. ""The Taiwan question is China's internal affair and resolving it is a matter for the Chinese that brook no foreign interference,"" Mao emphasised. She also noted that China has made clear on multiple occasions the nature of the South China Sea issue. ""China will neither take any inch of territory that is not ours, nor give up any inch of territory that belongs to us,"" Mao added.",world,india,0.3918918918918919,1036,38,27.263157894736842,47.022

""To take off an exhibition is something that usually is not done because we trust the building, we trust the safety of the showcases. But this is a different situation so we have to act accordingly,"" said Hagit Maoz, curator of the Shrine of the Book at Jerusalem's Israel Museum. The iconic building, shaped like the lids of the jars in which the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, is usually packed with visitors eager to glimpse the collection of ancient religious texts. Today the eight display cases lining the walls have paper notes saying ""temporarily removed"". Read more: Israel army confirms death of woman soldier held in Gaza The last time the museum removed the display, Maoz said, was during the 1991 Gulf War when Iraq fired missiles at Israel. The Hamas attack over a month ago sparked the war in Gaza, where Israel has since carried out a devastating bombardment and ground offensive. Thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel. Nurith Goshen, curator of Chalcolithic and Bronze Age archaeology, was cleaning up broken glass from a rocket strike near her home outside Jerusalem on Oct. 7 when the museum called announcing the war protocol and asking to confirm her list. ""You really have to choose the finest or the most fragile artefacts,"" she said. Her list included items on loan from the Louvre and the British Museum, and she said they got permission from those museums before taking them down. ""You really understand the meaning of what we are holding here, and what we have under our custodianship for Israel, but also for the world,"" said Goshen. The Tel Aviv Museum of Art took similar precautions. Gustav Kimt's Portrait of Friedericke Maria Beer, painted two years before his death, is now stored on a rack in a fortified underground bunker with other works. The paintings left behind blank spaces on the gallery's wall. ""These works of art have experienced war, some of them survived World War Two,"" said museum director Tania Coen-Uzzielli. ""We are custodians for a short time, and we needed to protect them. To protect them for posterity and for history."" ""Exciting news!

111,09:31:53,Palestinian children in the West Bank are also under attack,https://turks.us/palestinian-children-in-the-west-bank-are-also-under-attack/,"While the world’s focus is on Israel’s genocidal siege and bombing campaign in Gaza, Israel is also inflicting terror on Palestinians across the occupied West Bank. At least 186 people, including more than 30 children, have been killed there by the Israeli military and settlers since October 7. And nowhere in the occupied territories has seen more military aggression than the Jenin refugee camp, which to all intents and purposes has become a warzone. Since 2018, the Brighton Trust, an English charity that I am part of, has been helping fund the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre in the camp. It is a place where children can go to learn, play and socialise. In recent weeks, many have sought refuge from Israeli bombing in the Centre, and have been sleeping there because their homes have been destroyed. Like every corner of the overpopulated camp, the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre is currently under attack. In fact, it has been under attack for a long time. In July this year, during their violent incursion into Jenin which killed 12 Palestinians, Israeli soldiers also raided the Centre and wrecked it. They not only destroyed all facilities and equipment, including children’s books, but also punched large holes into the exterior walls of the building, leaving it barely habitable. Our charity, together with the British Shalom-Salaam Trust, had to raise money to repair the building and replace equipment. Children eventually returned to the Centre, but it was clear that they were not safe there. The Israeli military was determined not to allow Palestinians in Jenin to have peace and quiet, even at a centre for children. And things got significantly worse since Israel responded to Hamas’s October 7 attack with a genocidal bombing campaign in Gaza and increasingly aggressive and deadly military operations across the West Bank. A teacher at the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre wrote to me in mid-October about the horrific situation Jenin’s children have been in since the July incursion. “We did not have one peaceful night since [July],” she explained. “When the attacks on the Gaza Strip started, the attacks on the camp became even worse. Life got so hard that it feels like we can’t breathe. The soldiers are threatening that they will do the same to us in Jenin, as they are doing to people in Gaza. Actually, they have already started doing it, but the world is too busy elsewhere, showing only the Israeli side of the story. We have only one wish today. To have just one peaceful night, without waking up with the news that a family member or an entire family got killed.” She went on to tell me about the night soldiers entered her home and detained her family for hours as they tried to capture someone in the area. “They locked us up for three hours in the bathroom,” she said. “Even my brother’s baby, who is only 15 days old, was not allowed to get milk. These things start to feel normal here, but all the children are dying from inside. They don’t understand why this is happening. We are screaming, but no one hears us.” The same teacher wrote to me once again on October 27. “Each night we lose people, children. We buried lots, but because they die after the attack, the news never mentions them! Even our cemetery was bombed.” “Our Centre is in the middle of camp, the only lovely place for children. It is now very dangerous to reach, but the children find it the only place that can help them survive. I can’t tell them we are really in danger [at the centre]!” The media only talks about the Gaza Strip. But in the West Bank, the situation is very bad as well. Cities, villages and camps are all locked down and under near-constant attack. And everyone, including thousands of children, is at risk and suffering. Israel’s excuse for its murder and maiming of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in the Gaza Strip is that it is trying to “destroy Hamas”. In the West Bank, Hamas is not in power, yet Israel is increasing the repression and the violence. It is doing so because its real objective, in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, is not “destroying Hamas” or defeating any other enemy. Its true goal is, and has always been, ethnic cleansing. As we’ve already seen in a leaked Ministry of Intelligence document, Israel desires to annex the whole of Gaza and expel its population into the Sinai desert. The same is true in the West Bank even if, so far, the means of expelling the Indigenous population are not the same. Large areas of the West Bank had already been made Arabrein (“free of Arabs”) through the use of settler and army terror and pogroms before October 7. But in the last month, there has been an acceleration in Palestinians being forced out of their villages and homes. On October 28, the Palestinian community of in the South Hebron Hills had to pack up and leave their lands due to settler terror. This was just one of the eight communities that have been forced to abandon their homes and lands in the past four weeks. Six others have been partially evacuated after villagers have been told they will be killed if they refuse to leave. This is a pattern we have seen before. First, Palestinians in rural areas will be forced to leave their land and move into cities. Then, those in the cities will be pushed out into a third country. Israel has embarked on a second Nakba – not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. On November 9, there was yet another attack on Jenin, the most serious yet. 14 Palestinians were murdered, mostly by drones. During the attack, Al Tafawk Centre was tear gassed with the children still inside it and, according to some reports we received, live ammunition was used. Most of the children were evacuated, but about 20, owing to the inhalation of gas, were unable to. Later the same day, the teacher I’ve been in contact with risked her own life and went into the Centre to check up on the children. She found some of the children unconscious. It beggars belief how a children’s centre has become the object of a military attack unless the real goal is to destroy all Palestinian civil society organisations. On November 13, we received a distressing message from the Centre’s head teacher whose father has been arrested and beaten. She told us the Centre is barely operating because of the attacks of the Israeli army. People have no food, and many of the children don’t know what has happened to their families. The Al Tafawk Children’s Centre, and the Palestinian children trying to find peace and safety there, are now under attack. Like others in the Jenin camp, across the occupied West Bank, and in Gaza, they are being targeted, threatened and traumatised for the crime of being Palestinian, and trying to exist in their ancestral lands. They are telling us that “they cannot breathe”. That they are screaming, but no one is listening. The world cannot continue to ignore their plight. We have to help the children of Gaza, and the West Bank. We have to demand an immediate end to Israel’s brutal ethnic cleansing campaign.",world,turkey,0.34898388227049754,1427,71,20.098591549295776,73.897
112,06:05:00,Plunging popularity of Bahasa among Australian students could hurt future ties with Indonesia,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/plunging-popularity-of-bahasa-among-australian-students-could-hurt-future-ties-with-indonesia,"SYDNEY - At Australia’s largest university, Monash, an estimated 9,000 Australians started undergraduate studies in 2023. Yet fewer than 20 of these chose to study Bahasa Indonesia – the language of the country’s largest neighbour. The startlingly low intake at the university is part of a worrying trend that has played out across Australia at universities and schools. Of Australia’s more than 40 universities, just 12 now teach the language, down from 22 in 1992. The number of students learning Bahasa Indonesia in high schools in New South Wales, the most populous state, dropped from 306 in 2002 to 90 in 2022, according to figures published on The Conversation website. In the second most populous state, Victoria, the numbers dropped from 1,061 to 387 during the same period. Mr Zain Brown, 20, one of the few first-year undergraduates to study Bahasa Indonesia at Monash University in 2023, told The Straits Times that he developed an interest for the language after living in Jakarta with his family when he was eight to 13 years old. His parents, who work in the aid sector, both speak the language. Mr Brown, who is studying for an arts degree combined with a diploma of Indonesian language studies, said: “I think having a personal experience and a background with Indonesia made me want to study it.” Asked why he thought so few Australians choose to learn the language, he said: “A lot of Australians know Bali and basically not very much else about Indonesia.” Another student, Ms Catherine Morris, 19, who is studying the language and linguistics at the University of Western Australia (UWA), echoed this view, saying: “The first thing people ask me is, ‘Why?’” Ms Morris, who studied the language as a compulsory subject in high school and then took a liking to it, added: “Why would you not learn the language of one of your closest neighbours and an emerging trading partner? It is really important for Australians to learn it.” At UWA, just 75 students are learning the language at various levels, compared with about 320 each for Mandarin, Korean and Japanese. Part of the reason for the falling popularity of the Indonesian language studies is Australia’s monolingual culture, and the country has one of the lowest uptakes of foreign languages in the developed world. Dr Jessica Kruk, a lecturer in Indonesian Studies and Linguistics at UWA, said Australia had a “monolingual mindset”, which was reinforced by Australians’ experience of visiting Bali – a popular tourist destination, where visitors can often get by speaking English. Dr Kruk said there were also low levels of knowledge in Australia about Indonesian culture or about drawcards for potential students such as Indonesia’s economic growth, cultural diversity, or tech boom. “Students are typically interested in learning a language if they want to engage with the culture with which that language is associated,” she said. “There are still a lot of negative attitude towards Indonesia since the Bali bombings, and negative press that casts Indonesia as religiously conservative and a dangerous place,” she added, referring to the terrorist attacks in 2002 by Islamic extremists that killed 202 people including 88 Australians. “It is a vicious circle. The lack of knowledge leads to a lack of interest in studying (the language) that itself feeds a lack of knowledge.” The falling number of Indonesian language students has raised concerns about Canberra’s capacity to develop closer diplomatic and trade ties with Jakarta, just as Indonesia’s economy is growing, and the country is seen as a crucial future regional partner as tensions increase in the face of China’s rise. With a population of 279 million, Indonesia is the world’s 16th largest economy – Australia is 12th – but Indonesia is expected to become the world’s fourth largest by 2045. Experts say Australia must urgently boost investment in teaching Bahasa Indonesia in schools and universities. Similar efforts in the early 1990s led to a sharp increase in the number of students, but the funding and numbers have both since plunged. Dr Sharyn Davies, an expert on Indonesian studies at Monash University, said Australia’s diplomatic, trade and intelligence agencies will struggle to find Bahasa Indonesia speakers in future. “The government should be very worried about it,” she said. “The best way we can ensure stable friendships is to understand the other country.” Dr Davies said the media must do more to depict Indonesia’s strengths and diversity, and the business community also suffered from an “arrogant” assumption that it was not important for English-speakers to learn other languages. She said potential students are less attracted by arguments about a country’s strategic importance than perceptions that the country’s culture is “cool”. The Indonesian government, she noted, could do more to promote Indonesian culture. “We have seen the Korean language take off because it has K-pop and that cool factor,” she said. “Indonesia has that, too, but we need to be able to showcase that to students.” Still, Mr Brown, the student at Monash University, observed one advantage of the small number of students in his class, noting that his Indonesian language abilities may one day be his “most employable skill”. “A perverse side of it being such a small cohort is that I can imagine there will be good opportunities coming out of that for people who can speak it,” he said.",top,singapore,0.40172579098753597,1043,35,29.8,52.879
113,13:07:49,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

And it has now been reported that Jamie Vardy is 'desperately fighting' to keep earning money to fund Rebekah's lavish lifestyle. The WAG, 41, who was embroiled in the infamous Wagatha Christie scandal in May 2022, cost her family over £3million through out the high court battle. But that hasn't stopped her lavish lifestyle as she has since jetted off on a string of costly holidays. A source close to Jamie, 36, told The Sun : 'He must be tearing his hair out. It's like she's learnt nothing — their legal bills are astronomical and she just flaunts her wealth and glamorous holidays.' Lavish: Rebekah Vardy escaped the UK just days before Coleen Rooney's Wagatha Christie documentary launched Struggling: It has now been reported that Jamie Vardy is 'desperately fighting' to keep earning money to fund Rebekah's lavish lifestyle Jamie, who is heading into the final stages of his career at Leicester City, earns £140,000 a week, just over £7million a year before tax. Their pal continued: 'He's desperately fighting to keep going and earning big money while she blows it almost as quickly as he can make it, and he's at the end of his deal. 'She seems to have no concept of how much money she has cost them and what that actually means.' Coleen recently took aim at Rebekah in her Disney+ documentary, Coleen Rooney : The Real Wagatha Story, where the star took the opportunity to share her side of the story. Yet Rebekah refused to respond to the documentary as she fled abroad to Dubai with her family ahead of the films release. She posted a carousel of bikini snaps while soaking-up the sun on her recent holiday to the UAE. During her lavish getaway, Rebekah was last seen hanging out with former Love Islander Amber Wise, 19, the daughter of former footballer Dennis Wise. Brushing it off: It comes after Rebekah also posted a bikini-clad selfie from her holiday in Dubai as she avoided the release of the documentary, joking :'As am I [laughing face emoji]' Nude: Rebekah stripped off as she posed completely naked after jetting off with her pals to Las Vegas for a holiday after her 'horror accident' Rebekah then jetted off to Las Vegas where she shared a completely naked picture on the balcony of her hotel. She then couldn't resist posing for another snap from her balcony, showing off the luxurious views over Sin City. After going to watch Adele perform at Caesars Palace, she flaunted her bum in figure-hugging black leather trousers, showing her stunning figure. She left little to the imagination as she added a kissing emoji, treating her fans to the racy snap. Rebekah also took to Instagram on Saturday to share a racy snap of herself posing in the nude on the balcony of the luxury Cosmopolitan hotel in the Nevada city. She showed off her incredible figure as she looked out at the cityscape and held her hand in the air and flashed the peace out sign. Rebekah simply captioned the post on her Instagram grid with emojis but she added the caption 'Peace out b****es' on her Stories. Her Las Vegas holiday comes after Rebekah was said to have broken her left heel after being thrown from her horse and dragged after her left foot got caught. Having fun? It comes just days after Becky posted another suggestive photo to her Instagram feed, clad in skintight leather trousers Ouch! Rebekah recently broke her left heel after being thrown from her horse, but she didn't let the injury stop her holiday as she posed grinning while wearing a plastic air boot But she proved her injury would not slow her down as she also shared a snap of her posing with her plastic air boot on as she explored Las Vegas. Posing on an escalator, Rebekah flashed a huge smile as she posed with her injured leg in the air while surrounded by her pals. She wrote alongside the black and white snap: 'No stopping the boot,' referencing her injury. Rebekah has been exploring Las Vegas with her pals Vicky Davis, Craig Murray and Dan Shidlow, and the group have packed their trip full of activites. They all went to see Magic Mike Live before heading off to watch Usher perform at Dolby Live, with Rebekah sharing videos of the concert to her Instagram. Rebekah famously took Coleen to the High Court for libel – and lost – after Coleen claimed in October 2019 that stories about her were being leaked to the Press from Rebekah's social media account. Heartbreaking: On Wednesday, the WAG, 37, hit headlines following the release of her Disney+ documentary Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story, a limited series chronicling her legal battle with the fellow footballer's wife Vardy In Coleen's new publication, she gives fans an insight into the 2022 trial and also gives a 'full account' of her life, from her childhood to more recent events. Publisher Penguin states: 'Here, she recounts how she first suspected someone was betraying her trust (and how devastated it left her), and then the meticulous steps she took to identify, trap and finally reveal to the world her suspect. 'With the consequences playing out around the world and Coleen dragged unwillingly into a devastating court case whose outcome was far from certain, only now can she candidly give us her side of the story.' Coleen added in the press release: 'It was the biggest thing that had ever happened to me, and like nothing I’d ever experienced.

Michael Herrera testified under oath in front of the US Congress that he had stumbled across a 300-foot in the jungles of Indonesia. It was constantly changing colour from light grey to black “like someone was operating a dimmer switch” but was warned off by armed special forces personnel. Now, in a sensational new interview, he claims to have visited a secret government ”black site” that uses advanced weapons to “take down” extraterrestrial craft. As Herrera’s claims emerge, The has released an image of what was at the time described as a “hostile drone” shot down over Syria by an RAF Typhoon. The object – described in RAF reports as an “unidentified aerial phenomenon” [UAP] appeared to be a saucer or mushroom-shaped object. The MoD said the ""terrorist drone"" – which was destroyed on December 14 2021 - ""posed a threat"" to coalition forces fighting the Islamic State group in southern Syria. Jeremy Corbell from Weaponized told the Daily Star he had ""no idea"" if the Ministry of Defence would officially release this image. Michael Herrera made his claims in an interview with – the USAF fighter pilot turned podcaster with a special interest in the recent UAP revelations. He said in July this year that someone within the US military had reached out to him and asked if he wanted to go on a helicopter ride. “We end up going to a black site, which looks abandoned top side,” Michael said. “There’s no activity visible… genius on their part. But underneath the surface is a very different story. “It's a very active spot. They do a lot of scalar longitudinal weapon testing or EMPs this is a very advanced version but they have different types. “They have some that are so surgical that are very accurate then they have some that are kind of like a wave. The purpose of that facility is to actually take down ET craft and they do this about two to three times a year…” Herrera was very cautious not to name his source and avoided even mentioning the name of the unit he was working for. The only thing he did reveal is that he’d met this contact while providing security for controversial expert Dr Steven Greer. The US government has been doing “UFO crash retrievals since the 1940s”, he claimed. But he added that there were powerful business interests preventing the truth about UFOs from becoming public, because it would completely transform our way of life. He says that the US government has ET technology that could “change the world”. “There’s a lot of breakthroughs that could happen … that's not just transportation wise but we're talking about medical we're talking about the economy we're talking about technology with power – poverty would basically end overnight.”",top,united kingdom,0.5052631578947369,570,23,24.782608695652176,61.067

Hamas' s deadly assault on October 7 saw around 240 taken captive and at least 1,200 Israeli civilians killed. In response, Israel has begun a siege on Gaza to take out the terror group for good. Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that there will be no ceasefire in the war against Hamas until all of the hostages are returned. Abu Ubaida, the spokesman for Hamas said in an audio recording posted on the group's Telegram channel that they've offered a deal. 'Last week there was an effort from the Qatari brothers to release the enemy captives from women and children, in return for the release of 200 Palestinian children and 75 women detained by the enemy.' The armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas said on Monday it told Qatari mediators the group was ready to release up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in return for a five-day truce with Israel 'The truce should include a complete ceasefire and allow aid and humanitarian relief everywhere in the Gaza Strip,' he said. He accused Israel of 'procrastinating and evading' the price of the deal. Discussing the war at a news conference in Tel Aviv on Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel 'will not stop until we complete our mission' and that its only goal is to win. He said Hamas has 'lost its grip' on Gaza and there is now 'no place to hide'. Netanyahu said he still has daily contact with US President Joe Biden , and also has the 'political and ethical support' of the American administration. Several world leaders have come to visit Israel to show support but there are 'minorities that pressure the governments', he said. He urged the government to 'not succumb to this pressure' and said 'our war is their war'. 'No international pressure, no false accusations... will deviate us from our cause,' he said. Abu Ubaida, the spokesman for the armed wing of Hamas, al-Qassam Brigades, said in an audio recording posted on the group's Telegram channel that they've offered a deal Discussing the war at a news conference from Tel Aviv on Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel 'will not stop until we complete our mission' and that its only goal is to win (File Photo) This picture taken from the Israeli side of the border with the Gaza Strip on November 11, 2023, shows smoke rising over buildings during an Israeli strike on the Palestinian enclave Rejecting calls for a ceasefire, he said: 'If you want peace, we have to eliminate Hamas.'

120,11:31:09,US House votes against impeachment of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/us-house-votes-against-impeachment-of-dhs-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas-101699961013580.html,"The House voted Monday to push off a Republican effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ending for now a threat against the Cabinet secretary that has been brewing ever since Republicans took the House majority in January. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 8, 2023. REUTERS/Julia Nikhinson/File Photo(REUTERS) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right Republican from Georgia, forced a vote on impeaching Mayorkas to the floor through a rule that allows any single member to force a snap vote on resolutions, including constitutional matters such as impeachment. Eight Republicans joined with Democrats to vote 209-201 to send her resolution to committees for possible consideration, like any other bill. They are under no obligation to do anything. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Impeachment is usually reserved for grave misconduct in office but is instead being wielded in an extraordinary effort to remove Mayorkas for his handling of the southern border. The vote and its GOP support showed a growing appetite to reach for Congress’ most powerful weapons and redefine what the Constitution means by impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Impeaching a Cabinet official for their policy decisions would be unprecedented. Greene in a floor speech Monday accused Mayorkas of a “pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of the United States,” as she cited record numbers of illegal border crossings, an influx of drugs and his “open border policies.” The impeachment resolution accuses him of failing to adhere to his oath to “defend and secure our country and uphold the Constitution.” After the vote, Greene said she may try again to push an impeachment vote to the floor and argued her colleagues would face pressure from voters to impeach Mayorkas. ""Many Republicans, I would argue, are really tone deaf to their constituents and to their voters,” she said. Several prominent Republicans have become outspoken advocates of pushing forward on the GOP’s longstanding effort to impeach Mayorkas. House GOP whip Tom Emmer, the No. 3 House Republican, as well as Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican whose congressional district runs along the border with Mexico, voiced support for Greene’s resolution. During congressional testimony, Mayorkas has insisted that he is focused on securing the border and enforcing the law. “While the House Majority has wasted months trying to score points with baseless attacks, Secretary Mayorkas has been doing his job and working to keep Americans safe,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. Greene's resolution also calls the influx of migrants an “invasion."" Immigration advocates denounced her use of the term, saying it showed she was acting based on the racist “great replacement theory,” which purports that there is a plot to diminish the influence of white people in society. “Rep. Greene’s impeachment articles are a dangerous and racist political stunt and should be voted down by all of her colleagues in the House, regardless of their opinions on the policy actions of the Biden administration,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, in a statement. Republicans have closely scrutinized the Biden administration's handling of the border with Mexico for months and sought to build an impeachment case against Mayorkas. But Greene voiced frustration with the progress of those inquiries and pointed to a car crash in Texas that killed eight people after a driver suspected of smuggling people tried to flee the police and crashed into another vehicle. The renewed push to impeach Mayorkas is yet another headache for new House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is already juggling both a potential impeachment vote and delicate negotiations over government funding legislation to avert a federal shutdown at the end of the week. Johnson earlier this month said in a Fox News interview that he believed Mayorkas has committed “impeachable offenses,” but also warned that the House has “limited time and resources.” The speaker, who is just three weeks into his job, has also been supportive of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Only one U.S. cabinet official has ever been impeached: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. A House investigation found evidence that he had received kickback payments while administering government contracts. ""Exciting news!

121,11:17:45,Israeli minister supports ‘voluntary migration’ of Palestinians in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza?traffic_source=rss,"Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “voluntary migration” of Palestinians in Gaza is the “right humanitarian solution” for the besieged enclave and for the region, a stance Palestinian officials likened to supporting “ethnic cleansing”. Smotrich’s comments come after US lawmakers Danny Danon, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, and Ram Ben-Barak, former deputy director of the intelligence agency Mossad, published a comment piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting moving some of Gaza’s population to nations that will accept them. “I welcome the initiative of members of Knesset Ram Ben-Barak and Danny Danon on the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs to the countries of the world. This is the right humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza and the entire region,” Smotrich wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday. “A cell with a small area like the Gaza Strip, without natural resources and independent sources of livelihood, has no chance to exist independently, economically and politically, in such a high density for a long time. “The reception of refugees by the countries of the world that really want their best interests, with the support and generous financial assistance of the international community, and within the state of Israel is the only solution that will bring to the end of the suffering and pain of Jews and Arabs alike.” “The State of Israel will no longer be able to put up with the existence of an independent entity in Gaza,” he added. In response to his comments, Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said in a post on X that the minister “revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government”. “ himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding an unprotected civilian population.” Smotrich revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government. Netanyahu himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding unprotected civilian population — Mustafa Barghouti @Mustafa_Barghouti (@MustafaBarghou1) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously lobbied European leaders to help him convince the Egyptian president to take in refugees from Gaza. Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence had also outlined a proposal to “evacuate” all Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt. In March, Smotrich received after saying the Palestinian people are “an invention” of the past century, with Palestinian officials blasting his comments as proof of the “racist” outlook of Israel’s far-right government. In their article on Monday, Danon and Ben-Barak said Europe had a long history of assisting refugees fleeing conflicts, and off of that example, “countries around the world should offer a haven for Gaza residents who seek relocation”. “Countries can accomplish this by creating well-structured and internationally coordinated relocation programs,” they wrote. A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. Most people in Gaza today are the children or grandchildren of those displaced during the Nakba. They now risk being permanently uprooted again, which is a war crime under international law.",top,united states of america,0.43146417445482865,642,20,32.1,37.466

(Image: GETTY) The meeting between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden has “echoes” of Vladimir Putin’s political strategy ahead of his 2022 invasion of Ukraine , an analyst has warned Daily Express US. The summit comes amid soaring tensions between the US and China over issues including Beijing’s claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Joe Biden will ask Xi Jinping to tamp down on anti-US rhetoric while China will ask the same of the US, according to geopolitical analyst Kervin AuCoin. In addition, a reboot in military communications is essential amid a series of close calls between China and Western powers , Mr AuCoin said. He added: “Now, honing in on the military ties reboot? It's not just a nod; it's a neon sign flashing ‘We need to talk’. “Both sides want to tighten the screws on communication, a must-have in the Indo-Pacific. You've got strategic interests colliding there, and the goal is clear - cut the risk of accidental military showdowns.” READ MORE: North Korea fuels financial collapse fears as Kim Jong-un green-lights major change Joe Biden met with Vladimir Putin eight months before he invaded Ukraine. (Image: GETTY) Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the leaders will discuss ""strategic, general and directional issues concerning China-US relations, as well as major issues concerning global peace and development"". But it’s unclear if the talks will have the desired effects - Mr AuCoin says it reminds him of Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic strategy before he invaded Ukraine in 2022 . He added: “But here's where it gets interesting. The vibe of this meeting? Reminds me of Putin's prelude to the Ukraine invasion in 2022. Not saying history's repeating itself, but the echoes are there. “A seasoned eye would keep tabs on the nuances, and see if this is a game-changer or just another chapter in the diplomatic dance. “Xi could be biding his time making it look to US officials that he is calming the rhetoric while at the same time ramping up efforts for the invasion of Taiwan.” John Bolton: China's 'moment' to take over Taiwan is now Trending Putin and Joe Biden met in Switzerland in June 2021 just eight months before he launched a full-scale Ukraine sending relations between the West and Russia plummeting to lows not seen since the Cold War. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan could play out differently. The US has vowed to come to the democratically-run island’s aid in the event of an attack, although it's unclear what form this would take. But with the US stretched thin supporting both Israel and Ukraine , there have been concerns about its ability to support an ally on a third front should the Indo-Pacific spiral into conflict. While Biden and Xi attempt to achieve a breakthrough while meeting in San Francisco, Mr AuCoin warned: “Don’t hold your breath.” Become an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day FREE trial Follow Daily Express US Follow Daily Express US on Facebook and X (Image: EXPRESS) Get all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.

The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats. ADVERTISEMENT This incident follows a recent terrorist attack on police personnel in Tank, where three officers, including an SHO, were killed, and several others were injured. The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed numerous fatalities and injuries, primarily concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, accounting for the majority of attacks and counter-terror operations during this period. Recently, at least nine people, including five children, of the same family were killed when a rocket launcher's shell exploded at a house while the kids were playing with the ammunition in 's Sindh province, police said. Nine individuals were killed when a rocket shell they found while playing on the ground burst at home, according to Kashmore-Kandhkot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Rohil Khosa. The victims included five children, two women, and two adults from the same household, stated a report in agencies. In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital. ""This is an area on the riverine belt and the rocket shell must have been left there by dacoits who hide out deep into the riverine belt areas,"" Khoso stated. According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status.

What is the claim?: Users have written that it shows a Palestinian father and child being taken away by Israeli forces. An archive of the post can be found here . (Source: X/Screenshot) This post recorded three million views at the time of writing this story. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here .) Is it true?: This claim is false. The video dates back to 2015 and shows Israeli forces arresting the head of board members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee (PSCC) and activist Munther Amira and a 6-year-old child, Abdallah Lutfi Yousef from Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. Also Read Fact-Check: Altered Image Passed Off as Actor Gal Gadot Condemning Israel ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD How did we find out?: We divided the viral video into several keyframes and ran a Google reverse image search on some. We found the same video on a Facebook page named Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, which was uploaded on 17 November 2015 . The PSCC is a grassroots formation community-based resistance group spreading Palestine's cause in a non-violent manner. It was uploaded with a caption that read: ""Israeli occupation forces arrest of activist, and head of board members, of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, Munther Amira, and 6-year-old child, Abdallah Lutfi Yousef from Aida refugee camp."" Taking a cue from this, we ran a relevant keyword search and found news reports by RT and PNN Network that also dated back to 2015. RT reported on 18 November 2015 that the video was uploaded by the PSCC showed Israeli forces at the Aida refugee camp, near the West Bank city of Bethlehem , forcefully detaining two people, including a small boy. Similarly PNN's story from 17 November 2015 noted that the child was released after an hour due to the pressure from the ""Palestine's military liason and Amira was transferred to an unknown place."" Here is a preview of the report. This page has been translated from Arabic to English. (Source: PNN/Screenshot) Conclusion: Clearly the viral claim is false.

125,12:00:00,Saudi Arabia wants the Indian Premier League: Why is there no discussion of 'sportswashing'?,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4306629-saudi-arabia-wants-the-indian-premier-league-why-is-there-no-discussion-of-sportswashing/,"Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman previously said he does not care about allegations of “sportswashing” against his country, and that he would continue investing in sports if it adds to his country’s gross domestic product. Saudi Arabia’s recent expression of interest in buying a $5 billion stake in cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL), with a plan to place the IPL in a holding company worth up to $30 billion, only reinforces bin Salman’s seriousness about investing in sports. Saudi officials reportedly see an opportunity to massively expand the league presence internationally, including within the kingdom, similar to the English Premier League or the European Champions League Allegations of “sportswashing,” in this situation — of using sports to burnish a nation’s dodgy reputation — haven’t been aggressively levelled against the kingdom, a stark contrast to the or the contracts for , who both now play for Saudi football teams. The rather quiet response from western politicians is telling of several things as they relate to Saudi Arabia on the global stage. First, sportswashing can be a lazy rebuttal to the kingdom’s investment in sports and, in general, the Middle East. The definition of “sportswashing,” which is the practice of using sports to improve reputation, can be rather expansive in practice. Yes, we can all agree Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup to elevate the reputation of the country. So did Brazil with the 2016 Summer Olympics and South Africa with the 2010 World Cup and so will countries in the future. Saudi officials clearly know that sports can bring good attention to a country. (The Ministry of Culture has from NBA great Lebron James’s visit during September this year…yes Lebron James was in Saudi Arabia.) That said, it is not the sole reason for investing in sports, but it is obviously low-hanging fruit for politicians, because it will always contain some truth. Saudi Arabia is moving at a fast pace to change the country, and it has deep pockets to do so. Critics will note that women weren’t allowed to vote until 2011 and could not independently access health care and education without male supervision until 2017. Women also could not drive until 2018. For context, bin Salman began his rise to power in 2013, when he was named head of the Crown Prince’s Court with the rank of minister. He would be named crown prince in June 2017, when King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud deposed Muhammad bin Nayef. Since bin Salman has become crown prince, the country has hosted major boxing matches (such Anthony Joshua versus Andy Ruiz in 2019), launched LIV Golf in 2021 (which by 2023 was merged with the PGA tour) and took over Newcastle United in 2021. Additionally, Saudi football club Al-Nassr welcomed Ronaldo to the team at the start of this year, and, last month Riyadh was host to a boxing match between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou (with stars such as Kanye West and Mike Tyson in attendance) as a kickoff to Riyadh Season, which is a major festival where the city will host a series of huge shows and spectacles alongside a series of sporting events. Most of the Saudi sovereign deals have been executed via the country’s Public Investment Fund, which has reportedly made overtures in recent years to buy the WWE and Formula One. An investment in the IPL by the Public Investment Fund (or another entity) would fit well with the Saudis’ other sports investments — the IPL, for example, received sponsor bids up $6.2 billion for the right to broadcast games through 2027, which equates roughly to $15 million per match in a sport where the season lasts eight weeks. The per-match number is more than the English Premier League and slightly behind the $17 million per game for the National Football League in the U.S. Let’s also not forget that the kingdom has a significant Indian population between 10 and 12 percent who will be happy to have more access to IPL games. The push by Saudi Arabia (and other non-Western countries) into sports is fueling a “West versus everyone else” type of narrative. The quiet response to the reported offer for IPL versus the stir caused by LIV Golf (in competition with the PGA) suggests two different responses for deals done in the East versus deals done in the West. The PGA is sacred in the U.S. The IPL is unknown to Americans, so there are no political points to be gained by pushing back against this deal. However, the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, has also surprisingly faced little pushback for its estimated $200 million investment in Leonsis’s Monumental Sports, which controls the NBA’s Washington Wizards, the NHL’s Washington Capitals and the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. Qatar’s is the first sovereign fund to purchase a stake in a team in the top four U.S. sports leagues. (MLS club New York City FC is majority-controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi.) Skeptics will say Qatar is becoming an important ally to the U.S., so there is little political upside to criticizing this deal. (For example, Qatar is the go-between with Hamas for Israel and the U.S.) Countries accused of sportswashing are largely non-western countries, such as Qatar with the 2022 World Cup and China with the 2022 Winter Olympics. Was the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics an example of sportswashing? Or, how do we distinguish between the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics in this conversation? Are both examples of sportswashing, or only the 2022 games? Historians can reference the 1934 World Cup in Mussolini’s Italy and the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, but that retroactive application of sportswashing ignores how little the language of sportswashing was used before the 2000s (or even 2010s). One can even argue that Hitler hosted the Olympics in 1936 to prove the superiority of the “pure German” race over any other race, only to have black American athlete Jesse Owens star in the games. Eighteen black athletes would participate in those 1936 games (and elevate the prominence of the U.S.) only to be forgotten and dismissed upon their return home to the U.S. That time in history was more about proving superiority of countries and races than it was about sportswashing. Regardless, Saudi Arabia is not Nazi Germany or Mussolini’s Italy and nor does not have the U.S. 1936 racial issues. Furthermore, the West as the arbitrator of who is sportswashing based on human rights has generally permitted those best allied to the West to escape criticism more than those less allied to the U.S. This positioning of countries on a theoretical human rights spectrum obfuscates the conversation on sportswashing by masking over the behaviors of certain countries versus others to maintain Western moral superiority. The discussion in this fashion also muddies the waters by ignoring any complicity of other countries in alleged human rights violations. Indeed, it may be better to ask why we should care if any country is sportswashing. Individuals and countries can boycott “problem” countries by avoiding travel to those countries, not participating in certain games or sports in those countries, or cutting aid and investment within those countries, if they feel obliged to do so. Sports organizers and leaders, for their part, may simply want to avoid being dragged into each political or cultural debate. Sports are the best uniters of societies and culture — we can see this across American racial lines and South African racial lines as well as different religions groups in the Middle East and Asia. Maybe the 2026 World Cup, collectively hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, can solve all the border issues between the three countries. Even the most optimistic person is somewhat pessimistic about this outcome. But, if the games run smoothly, could Mexico accuse the U.S. of sportswashing, or vice versa? Lastly, it looks like Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, as it was the sole bidder). To call it sportswashing in 2034 will sound odd in a historic context — that would suggest bin Salman is genius for planning 11 years ahead on another cover-up.

After days of heavy air strikes around Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, witnesses said tanks and armoured vehicles were metres (yards) from the besieged facility, which has become a focal point of the five-week-old war. The United Nations believes that thousands, and perhaps more than 10,000 people -- patients, staff and displaced civilians -- may be inside and unable to escape because of fierce fighting nearby. Amid reports of premature babies dying for lack of electricity and patients facing gunfire, a surgeon working for Doctors Without Borders said the situation inside the hospital had become ""very bad"". ""We don't have electricity. There's no water in the hospital. There's no food,"" said the doctor, who was not named by his organisation. ""It is inhuman."" Israel accuses Hamas fighters of using tunnels under the hospital as a command ""node"", effectively engaging the sick and injured as human shields. It is a charge that Hamas denies. Israel says it is not targeting the hospital, but has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the attacks of October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians and resulted in 240 hostages being taken back to Gaza. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's assault has already killed 11,240 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children. Israel says 46 of its troops have been killed in fighting in Gaza. Biden called on Israel to use ""less intrusive action relative to the hospital"", some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date. ""The hospital must be protected,"" he told reporters. Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner insisted Al-Shifa was ""central in Hamas's command and control capabilities"", but said troops were currently ""stand-offish"". ""The idea is to try to evacuate the people, evacuate as many as possible,"" he said. Underscoring the role that global public opinion is playing in the war, both sides have repeatedly given vastly different accounts of events. Lerner put the number of people inside the hospital at ""a few hundred"", while the Hamas government's deputy health minister Youssef Abu Rish, who is present in the hospital, said about 20,000 displaced people had sought refuge there. Hamas's brutal attacks of October 7 and Israel's massive response have sparked protests around the world, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in the Middle East, Europe and beyond. Israel's supporters insist it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country's 75-year history -- an attack that brought painful echoes of past pogroms against the Jewish people. But Israel's critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza. International aid agencies speak of hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a rolling humanitarian catastrophe. Israel's top diplomat admitted Monday that his nation has ""two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up."" Quoted by his spokesman, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen added that Israel is working to ""broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary."" In the face of mounting pressure, Israel has agreed to daily pauses in military operations around specified humanitarian ""corridors"" to allow Gazans to flee fighting. Israeli leaders have so far insisted there will be no broader ceasefire before hostages are released. But Qatar is mediating talks on a possible deal to free the hostages. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's military wing, said Monday that a possible deal would involve the release 100 Israeli hostages in return for 200 Palestinian children and 75 women held in Israeli prisons. ""We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce... and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,"" Abu Obeida said in an audio statement. Biden said he was ""somewhat hopeful"" the Qatar-mediated talks could lead to a deal. As security officials and diplomats continued negotiations, Hamas released a video of a young woman who was said to be an Israeli soldier held in Gaza. The Israeli army later confirmed the identity of the woman. ""Our hearts go out to the Marciano family, whose daughter, Noa, was brutally kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist organisation,"" the army said in a statement. Army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital, showing footage of a baby bottle and a rope near a chair. In the video he showed neatly arranged assault rifles, grenades and what Hagari said were ""vests with explosives"". The war in Gaza has also spurred violence on other fronts. In the northern West Bank, five Palestinians were killed in clashes around the city of Tulkarem, the director of a local hospital told AFP on Tuesday. After repeated strikes on US forces in the Middle East, the United States launched air attacks that killed at least eight pro-Iran fighters in eastern Syria, a Britain-based monitoring group said. On Monday, Israel used fighter jets to strike what it said were ""operational command centres"" belonging to Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah inside Lebanon. Fighting in Gaza AFP Relatives of Israeli hostages taken by Palestinian militants in the October 7 attack react during a demonstration calling for their release in Tel Aviv on November 13, 2023. AFP Israeli soldiers and civilians attend the funeral of Matan Meir, a member of the ""Fauda"" production team who was killed in combat while on reserve duty for the Israeli army in Gaza, on November 13, 2023 at Moshav Odem in the annexed Golan Heights. More than 11,000 people have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war erupted after Palestinian militants raided southern Israel on October 7 killing at least 1200 people, according to official Israeli figures. AFP Patients and internally displaced people are pictured at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on November 10, 2023, amid ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement. Heavy fighting was raging near Al-Shifa hospital, with Israel saying it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas's capacity to fight. AFP © Copyright AFP 2023.

Though Schnapp could not be seen holding the stickers which read “Zionism is sexy” and “Hamas is ISIS”, he appeared to be smiling as he filmed those who were showing the stickers off. Schnapp has been vocal in his support for Israel since the conflict escalated on October 7. The footage has gone viral after being reposted on Twitter, where the divisive stickers have sparked fury among pro-Palestinian accounts who have taken umbrage at the way the stickers appeared to be paraded joyfully by Noah Schnapp‘s friends. Noah Schnapp labeled a ‘Zionist’ after viral sticker footage In a video originally posted to Instagram stories but re-uploaded to Twitter by culture hub Pop Base, a group of around five people, including what appears to be Schnapp and influencer Moti Ankari, can be seen smiling and laughing. It appears they show off the stickers to the camera. Ankari can be seen holding a “Zionism is sexy” sticker to his head and posing, while a red sticker declaring that “Hamas is ISIS” sits next to Schnapp, who is smiling and filming the group. The footage has prompted outrage on social media, with one user labeling Schnapp “disgustingly zionist” for his role in the clip. Noah Schnapp publicly promotes stickers containing phrases “Zionism is Sexy” and “Hamas is Isis” via Instagram stories. pic.twitter.com/VZwl3Avn2G— Pop Base (@PopBase) November 13, 2023 The term Zionist is a rather loaded one, used to refer to somebody who supports the protection and maintenance of the land of Israel. The concept of Zionism is particularly controversial at this moment in time. The Israel-Palestine conflict derives from a deep-seated dispute over the land that 19th-century Zionists occupied when establishing a homeland for Jewish people – land that Palestinians maintain they have the rights to. HITC has reached out to representatives of Noah Schnapp for comment. EXPLORED: TikTok star Elphaba Doherty debunks death claims Schnapp said he is “afraid” to be a Jewish American just now The sticker controversy is not the first time Schnapp has been in the headlines since the conflict escalated following the Hamas attacks on October 7. In the week following the attacks, Schnapp took to Instagram to share his thoughts on the matter with his 25 million followers. “As a Jewish American, I am afraid.” Wrote Schnapp, who is best known for his role as Will Byers on Stranger Things. “Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel, who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas.” He continued. Schnapp went on to note that though he wished for peace between the two nations, the comments he had reportedly received from pro-Palestinian accounts in response to his posts on the matter had been “wrong”. In the weeks since his statement, relations between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian/pro-ceasefire campaigners online are yet to improve, with no plausible end to the conflict in sight at the time of writing.

Aboard the presidential plane PR001, the Chief Executive will be embarking on a half-day flight to San Francisco. He is scheduled to arrive there the same day. California is 16 hours behind Manila. “I bring with me your hopes and aspirations for a peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific region where we live,” Marcos said in his departure speech on Tuesday. “Our APEC work has been focused to prioritize and secure beneficial trade and investment, quality and green jobs, and human development and poverty alleviation,” he added. Marcos will join other leaders of APEC member economies in San Francisco for the 30th installment of the annual summit . The leaders’ meeting will take place from November 15 to 17, but senior finance officials and ministers held preparatory talks from November 11 to 14. Founded in 1989 as an informal dialogue group, APEC has grown to include 21 member-economies, including the Philippines. Because it groups economies rather than nations, the Chinese-ruled Hong Kong and the self-ruled Taiwan are also allowed to participate in the annual meeting. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said, “This year’s APEC theme aligns with the economic agenda of the administration of President Marcos Jr., the Philippine Development Plan and the administration’s 8-point socioeconomic agenda and visage an economic transformation for a prosperous, inclusive and resilient Philippines by prioritizing the creation of more quality and green jobs.” Marcos will join other leaders in San Francisco amid continued Chinese harassment of Philippine ships in the West Philippine Sea. Chinese President Xi Jinping will participate in the the APEC Summit. Hawaii stop, Filipino community meeting In San Francisco, Marcos is set to deliver a keynote address on “intentional equity in sustainability” at the APEC CEO Summit, one of the side events during the week-long gathering. He is also set to meet with business leaders and join panels on the sidelines of the summit. During his US trip, Marcos will visit the United States Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, which is the US military’s biggest unified geographic combatant command. Soldiers under the Indo-Pacific Command usually train with Philippine counterparts during the biggest annual military exercise between Manila and Washington. Marcos’ visit there is symbolic, signaling his attempt to further strengthen ties with the US, a treaty ally which has condemned Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea. Marcos’ return to Hawaii is also notable because it marks his public return to the island state that accommodated his family after Filipinos kicked their family out of the Philippines during the February 1986 People Power Revolution. Hawaii is where his father – the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos – died in 1989. The Marcos family stayed in Hawaii for five years, returning to the Philippines in 1991 after the Corazon Aquino government allowed them to face the cases against them back home. Since then, the Marcoses have successfully reentered Philippine politics, rehabilitating their image through a decades-long project capped by Marcos Jr.’s landslide presidential election victory in 2022. Marcos is scheduled to visit the Filipino community in Honolulu. Before flying to Hawaii, he is expected to make a stopover at Los Angeles for a meet-and-greet with the Filipino diaspora there. This is Marcos’ 10th trip for the year, and 16th since he became president. It’s also his third trip to the US since becoming president – the first in September 2022 for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and the second in May this year for an official working visit that included a visit to the White House in Washington DC. Marcos has gained a reputation for being a jet-setting chief executive, with nearly P400 million spent in international travel in 2022 alone. For 2024, his office is seeking P1.4 billion for trips and state visits.

May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679

And all of these are totally valuable and human and we need to acknowledge and appreciate and accept every part of our experience."" ""But sometimes when you love very deeply you will find yourself facing terrifying fears of loss that can feel so big and devastating that you don't know how you can survive them and you can't imagine life without this person that you love. It's in these moments when you are staring into the abyss that you have an opportunity to expand your consciousness beyond the limitations of your mind.

""Fear is an unknown place and this is what makes it so frightening, we makeup stories about what is beyond the fear and they are not happy stories. But we can choose to stay present with everything that unfolds and to feel as much as possible in every moment and we can be surprised that there are more moments of beauty and grace and even joy than we ever imagined.""

Tomorrow morning (Tuesday) they will move to Cairo,"" Lubna's husband Nedal Toman said in a text message sent to PTI from Gaza. Follow LIVE updates on Israel-Hamas war The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region -- in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo -- for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. ""We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,"" she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their ""water supply was officially cut off"" in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn't seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.

138,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism.

But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

139,11:17:45,Israeli minister supports ‘voluntary migration’ of Palestinians in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza?traffic_source=rss,"Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “voluntary migration” of Palestinians in Gaza is the “right humanitarian solution” for the besieged enclave and for the region, a stance Palestinian officials likened to supporting “ethnic cleansing”. Smotrich’s comments come after US lawmakers Danny Danon, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, and Ram Ben-Barak, former deputy director of the intelligence agency Mossad, published a comment piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting moving some of Gaza’s population to nations that will accept them. “I welcome the initiative of members of Knesset Ram Ben-Barak and Danny Danon on the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs to the countries of the world. This is the right humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza and the entire region,” Smotrich wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday. “A cell with a small area like the Gaza Strip, without natural resources and independent sources of livelihood, has no chance to exist independently, economically and politically, in such a high density for a long time. “The reception of refugees by the countries of the world that really want their best interests, with the support and generous financial assistance of the international community, and within the state of Israel is the only solution that will bring to the end of the suffering and pain of Jews and Arabs alike.” “The State of Israel will no longer be able to put up with the existence of an independent entity in Gaza,” he added. In response to his comments, Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said in a post on X that the minister “revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government”. “ himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding an unprotected civilian population.” Smotrich revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government. Netanyahu himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding unprotected civilian population — Mustafa Barghouti @Mustafa_Barghouti (@MustafaBarghou1) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously lobbied European leaders to help him convince the Egyptian president to take in refugees from Gaza. Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence had also outlined a proposal to “evacuate” all Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt. In March, Smotrich received after saying the Palestinian people are “an invention” of the past century, with Palestinian officials blasting his comments as proof of the “racist” outlook of Israel’s far-right government. In their article on Monday, Danon and Ben-Barak said Europe had a long history of assisting refugees fleeing conflicts, and off of that example, “countries around the world should offer a haven for Gaza residents who seek relocation”. “Countries can accomplish this by creating well-structured and internationally coordinated relocation programs,” they wrote. A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. Most people in Gaza today are the children or grandchildren of those displaced during the Nakba. They now risk being permanently uprooted again, which is a war crime under international law.",top,united states of america,0.43146417445482865,642,20,32.1,37.466

142,17:49:29,"Over 1,000 Protesters Shut Down Chicago Train Station to Demand Ceasefire",https://truthout.org/articles/over-1000-protesters-shut-down-chicago-train-station-to-demand-ceasefire/,"More than a thousand demonstrators from across the Midwest gathered at the Ogilvie Transportation Center in downtown Chicago on Monday to demand that the U.S. government pressure Israel into agreeing to a ceasefire in its genocidal war on Palestinians in Gaza. The action, organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, Never Again Action and others, began around 9 a.m. Central Time. More than one thousand demonstrators from several states in the Chicagoland area and beyond took part in the action, interrupting transportation plans for commuters at the station and disrupting business at the nearby Israeli consulate offices, which are in the same building as the Ogilvie Transportation Center. Demonstrators began the protest without warning, reportedly milling about the station before heading to the escalators at the designated time. The protest went on for several hours. Protesters came from Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin and all corners of Illinois, according to a JVP press release. Organizers say the demonstration is “the largest Midwest gathering of Jews in solidarity with Palestinians in U.S. history.” Organizers sought to demonstrate that demands for a ceasefire weren’t just being made in U.S. coastal states, as evidenced by other protests in recent weeks , but in the heartland of the U.S. as well. “No one expected that such actions could occur anywhere else. But in the Midwest, where progressive Jewish communities are far smaller and separated by distance, there has been such a surge in support for a ceasefire,” JVP said in its press release. Demonstrators sang songs and chanted slogans, including “Free, Free, Palestine,” “ceasefire now!” and more. They also held signs in support of a ceasefire, including “Jews Say Ceasefire Now,” “End Israeli Apartheid,” and “NICU Dads against Attacking NICUs,” referencing the Israeli military’s recent attacks on hospitals in Gaza . State Sen. Robert Peters, a Democrat in the Illinois legislature who recently converted to Judaism, spoke before the demonstrators. “How is it that disproportionately bombing the crap out of kids is gonna make you safer?” Peters asked the crowd, which erupted into cheers. Peters added that there was a need for “global solidarity” to demand “a fucking ceasefire” right now. At around 10 a.m., organizers alerted the crowd that they could face arrest if they remained around the escalators, and that if they wanted to leave they could continue protesting in front of the building. About three-quarters of protesters did so, with dozens remaining on and around the escalator after the warning was given. Police began arresting protesters around 10:30 a.m. Participants in the protest spoke to Truthout about what compelled them to take part. “I came here from Milwaukee in anger, rage, and determination to demand ceasefire now,” said Jodi Melamed, co-coordinator of Jewish Voice for Peace in Milwaukee. “I want people to see that Jews say ‘no’ to the inhuman cruelty we are seeing in Gaza. I want them to know that Jews see fighting antisemitism, fighting Islamophobia, and fighting for Palestinian lives are all part of the same fight.” Melamed also condemned Washington for its complicity in Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. “Israel’s war crimes are U.S. war crimes,” Melamed said. “My tax dollars are killing my friends’ families in Gaza. They are carrying out a genocide in our name.” “I am here today, as a part of the largest contingent of Midwestern Jews in solidarity with Palestinians IN HISTORY, to call for an immediate ceasefire, hostage exchange, and end to the unfolding genocide,” said Simone Pass Tucker, a member of IfNotNow. “I am called to take action because of my Palestinian friends in the West Bank and in diaspora.” “We are progressive Jews, and our perspective matters. … We are here to say that this violence and genocide is not being done in our name,” said JVP member Margo Mejia. Mejia added: Jackson Potter, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union, also participated in the demonstration. In a statement he made earlier in the day, Potter said that the union, which has endorsed calls for a ceasefire, is “deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life and indiscriminate bombing throughout Gaza, where half the Palestinians living there are children.” “As a fighting union dedicated to the adherence of human rights, our most important representative body voted overwhelmingly in favor of a ceasefire to stop the senseless bloodshed of innocents and call for the return of all hostages,” Potter added. “We can’t stand idly by while the U.S. government continues to send weapons and military aid with the tax dollars that would be better spent addressing the root causes of violence. We need a ceasefire to save Palestinian and Israeli lives, bring Israeli hostages home, and pull the region back from the brink of catastrophic war. And we need more fighting unions across the country to join us in this movement.” Israel’s current military campaign against Palestinians in Gaza began after a Hamas-led infiltration attack on October 7 . Since then, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has killed over 11,000 Palestinians , including more than 4,500 children. Several international organizations have condemned Israel’s genocidal siege of Gaza, including its blockade of vital food, water, fuel and medicine, with one United Nations agency describing the situation as a “humanitarian tragedy of colossal proportions.” Israel announced last week that it would begin four-hour “humanitarian pauses” in its relentless bombardment of Gaza following pressure from U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden. The announcement has been condemned by critics for whitewashing Israel’s horrific violence against Palestinians. “There is something so uniquely evil about ‘a humanitarian pause.’ It’s an Orwellian demand to continue taking human life indiscriminately with moments of reprieve, so that the kill have some food, water and bandages before they are targeted again,” media critic Sana Saeed said on social media . “It is torture before the kill.”",top,united states of america,0.4222027972027972,1144,44,26.0,47.847

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

Marking the worst start in the history of the , the film is said to have underperformed due to lacklustre buzz and star being unable to promote the film or do any interviews, due to the now-ended actors' strike in Hollywood. Of course, there's also the case of superhero movie fatigue, with dwindling interest in the genre causing audiences to be pickier about what they're spending money on. It has been a less than stellar year for Marvel. from earlier this year was heavily panned by critics and fans alike for its poor CGI effects, and its Secret Invasion show hasn't fared well either. The newest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) made $47 million (about Rs. 391 crore) within the US and Canada, with initially hoping to debut with a $75 million (about Rs. 624 crore) collection in the region. has also struggled internationally, simply earning $63.3 million (about Rs. 527 crore), against a total production budget of $200 million (about Rs. 1,664 crore). According to , as usual, China was among the top contributors, though not by a huge margin, grossing $11.7 million (about Rs. 97 crore) in ticket sales. Following in close second is the UK with $4.3 million (about Rs. 35 crore) in earnings, while the Indonesian region adds $3.7 million (about Rs. 39 crore) to the pot. South Korea comes fourth, a little short of Indonesia's numbers at $3.5 million (about Rs. 29 crore), while France takes the no. 5 spot, having earned $3.1 million (about Rs. 25 crore). Directed by Nia DaCosta, The Marvels fell short of expectations critically as well, earning a 62 percent rating on aggregator website , with many calling out its cluttered storyline. This could be attributed to the four weeks of reshoots the film underwent, while its director headed out to work on another movie during the post-production stage. DaCosta attested this claim, adding that her last-minute departure wasn't ‘dramatic' and that by then, everyone involved knew what the final cut of The Marvels was supposed to be. “For me personally, it was that they moved the date of the film four different times,” she said in an . “They knew the entire time that I had an obligation—a green-lit movie with people who were waiting for me. And I pushed that and then I pushed it again and then I pushed it again.” It also doesn't help that The Marvels opened the same day dropped its latest movie , serving as the acclaimed filmmaker's return to a thriller genre since 2019's . The film was readily accessible on a streaming platform and therefore, it's plausible to assume that audiences trusted Fincher's namesake and chose to watch that instead. Serving as a direct sequel to 2019's , The Marvels is set in a destabilised universe where Carol Danvers (Larson), Kamala Khan ( ), and Captain Monica Rambeau's ( ) power get tangled, forcing them to synergise and thwart the evil Kree imperialist Dar-Benn.

146,18:36:11,Genocide in Gaza: A call to urgent global action,https://thefrontierpost.com/genocide-in-gaza-a-call-to-urgent-global-action/,"Ihsan Adel & Katherine Gallagher A week into Israel’s war on Gaza, 800 eminent scholars and practitioners of law sounded the alarm about an imminent genocide in the territory. What made this warning both powerful and chilling was that so many legal experts came to this sombre conclusion together. It is not a claim that can be made easily. Since that letter was released, the situation in Gaza has only gotten worse. The death toll has passed 11,000, while some 2,650 individuals, including approximately 1,400 children, are reported missing, potentially trapped or deceased beneath the rubble. Tens of thousands of wounded are overwhelming struggling medical facilities. The humanitarian situation has reached horrific levels, compounded by the lack of food, water, fuel and electricity. To understand what is transpiring in Gaza, we must turn to the key legal frameworks that define genocide: Article 6 of the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court and Article 2 of the Genocide Convention. According to these documents, genocide involves acts committed with the specific intent to destroy, either in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. These acts encompass killing members of the group, causing them serious harm, and imposing conditions of life aimed at physical destruction of the group in whole or in part, among other underlying acts. Notably, the people targeted can be a geographically limited part of the group. Gaza’s devastating reality mirrors these components of genocide. Despite claiming to target only Hamas, Israel is engaged in an all-out assault on the whole population of Gaza. In just the first week of its relentless assault, it dropped more than 6,000 bombs on the Strip – nearly as many as the United States used in Afghanistan in a full year. Using high-impact munitions in one of the most densely populated places in the world inevitably leads to a high death toll among civilians, as we have witnessed already in Gaza. In a month, the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 4,400 children and 2,900 women, with many of the men in these horrific statistics also non-combatants. The Israeli army has also dropped any pretence to “precision strikes”, as its spokesperson Daniel Hagari said its emphasis is “on damage and not accuracy”. It has also mass-targeted civilian buildings, including hospitals and schools sheltering the displaced. It has bombed residential buildings, wiping out whole families from the population registrar; more than 45 percent of homes were destroyed or damaged, many of them in the supposed “safe areas” of the south where the Israeli army had instructed Palestinians to evacuate to. This mass killing of civilians is accompanied by the imposition of life conditions aimed clearly at the physical destruction of the Palestinian people. Israel has put Gaza under complete siege, with “no electricity, no food, no water, no gas”, as declared by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. Israel’s bombing of hospitals, the targeting of their solar panels and the blocking of fuel deliveries indicate an intent to prevent Palestinians from accessing life-saving healthcare. More than one-third of hospitals and two-thirds of primary healthcare in Gaza have already shut down. The Israeli refusal to allow adequate amounts of much-needed humanitarian aid – including food and water – indicates it is willing to allow the Palestinian population to succumb to starvation and disease. Israeli government and military officials have also verbalised their genocidal intent towards the Palestinian people. On October 9, when announcing the full blockade, Gallant described the 2.3 million people in Gaza as “human animals”. On October 29, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used Judaic scripture to justify the killing of Palestinians. “You must remember what Amalek did to you, says our Holy Bible,” he said, quoting a verse that goes on to say: “Now go and smite Amalek … kill both man and woman, infant.” On November 5, Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu said one of Israel’s options in Gaza is to drop a nuclear bomb. He also explained that no humanitarian aid should be provided to Palestinian civilians as “there is no such thing as uninvolved civilians in Gaza”. While his statement faced criticism from Israeli officials, the concerns raised were primarily centred around the potential impact on “Israel’s image” rather than acknowledging the grave implications of such remarks as a potential tool of genocide. There has been a litany of other official statements employing dehumanising language towards Palestinians, along with incitement by common Israelis for the “annihilation of Gaza”. These reveal the intent to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and, indeed, genocide. In the words of genocide expert and survivor of the Bosnian genocide, Arnessa Buljusmic-Kastura, “That sort of rhetoric is not uncommon when it comes to cases of genocide. It is obviously one of the most important stages when you really consider it, and to hear the openly dehumanising language spoken with so much fervour in the media from government leaders, and from regular people too, is horrifying and it all leads us to where we are at right now, which is the fact that what is happening in Gaza is a genocide.” While what is happening in Gaza shares common features with other previous situations of genocide, there are also particular elements unique to it. Among these distinct features are the enduring occupation of Palestinian lands, the relentless siege on Gaza, and the staggering proportion of the Palestinian nation already displaced by previous acts of ethnic cleansing. Additionally, at the heart of this tragedy lies a discourse of dehumanisation, serving both as a strategy and an outcome. The longstanding anti-Palestinian discourse, ongoing since the inception of Zionism, has systematically denied the existence and the rights of Palestinians. The narrative of Israel as “a land without a people, for a people without a land” has effectively erased an entire indigenous population, along with its history, heritage, and grievances. In parallel, Palestinians have been systematically demonised through narratives that portray them as terrorists, anti-Semites, and even Nazis. Evoking absurd claims of the “Nazification of Palestinians”, Israel, a powerful settler colonial state that has presided over the longest occupation in modern history, is trying to depict itself as a victim; its tormentor – the people it has systematically oppressed and dispossessed for decades. It is imperative to grasp these distinct aspects of the unfolding genocide in Gaza, as we confront and respond to it. We must not forget that what is happening now is part of a long history of Israeli actions against the Palestinians, extending beyond the Gaza Strip, with genocidal intent and practices targeting other Palestinian communities We must not forget it as Israel and its allies try to decontextualise what is going on in Gaza and portray it as a war “provoked” by Hamas’s October 7 attack. Talk about self-defence for Israel is dominating Western rhetoric, with minimal consideration for human lives and adherence to the rules of armed conflict, let alone the 56-year military occupation and 16-year siege of Gaza. This constitutes a fundamental flaw in the appraisal of these events, and, consequently, the ability to address their root causes, as subtly alluded to by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his October 24 address to the Security Council. The lessons of the Holocaust were meant to serve as safeguards against state violence and genocide, particularly for vulnerable groups. What we are witnessing today, however, is an unprecedented global dehumanisation campaign against the Palestinians, pushing their narratives, experiences, and histories to the margins. Historically, the initiation of such campaigns has often been a precursor to genocide. Therefore, it is imperative to restore the Palestinian people’s humanity and recognise their shared history and rights, as a people, as we push for an immediate cessation of the unfolding genocide. We are witnessing a rapidly growing anti-Palestinian sentiment not only in Israel but also in many European countries, clearly visible in how the authorities are dealing with demonstrations and support for the Palestinian people. It is incumbent upon the international community to address this hatred with the same vigour as it has addressed anti-Semitism. While the 1949 Geneva Conventions require all state parties “to respect and ensure respect” of these conventions in all circumstances, the Genocide Convention places a legal obligation on every member state to prevent and punish even the attempt to commit this heinous crime, without waiting for it to fully manifest. “Never again” was meant to be a warning for future generations, yet we have seen genocides occur since the Holocaust, met with global silence. It is time to make “never again” a living principle, an urgent call to action. In Gaza, “never again” is now.",top,pakistan,0.4057971014492754,1656,58,28.551724137931036,37.989

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups.

While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

148,10:00:52,These are Canada’s most popular pet names of 2023,https://torontosun.com/life/life-essentials/these-are-canadas-most-popular-pet-names-of-2023,"Much like with babies, a lot of research goes into finding the perfect name for one’s pet. A new report from Rover.com looked at the most influential pet trends of the year that determined how some people named their dogs and cats. The results were based on millions of user-submitted pet names provided by pet parents on the online pet care marketplace between September 2023 and October 2023. Pop culture reigned supreme in 2023, resulting in many pet names coming from the worlds of celebrities and sports. “A lot happened in 2023 and the names we lovingly chose for our pets reflect our most memorable moments,” Kate Jaffe, trend expert at Rover , said. “But timeless hockey stars and the country’s national emblem, Maple, prove Canadians still tap into nostalgia when it comes to naming their best friends.” A post shared by Rover (@roverdotcom) The most popular female dog names in Canada were Luna, Bella, Daisy, Molly and Lucy, while the top male dog names were Charlie, Milo, Max, Cooper and Leo. Aside from the top choice, female cat names varied with Luna, Lily, Bella, Lucy and Nala, but three of the five male dog names were also on the cat list with Leo, Milo, Charlie, Oliver and Simba on top. Hockey players, past and present, gave lots of owners name ideas, with Gretzky coming in as the leading sports-inspired name of the year, up 591%, according to the report. Connor McDavid provided inspiration with Connor up 63%, while Dillion is up 191%, perhaps for Houston Rockets forward Dillon Brooks, who was named Best Defensive Player at the 2023 FIBA World Cup. Cat parents still have retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady top of mind, with Brady up 273%, placing No. 1 as a top trending name. Another NFLer made the cut — by association. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce’s new girlfriend Taylor Swift moved up the charts with the moniker Swifty up 173% this year among cats and Swift also making the list for the first time. The singing superstar is well-known for her love of cats, after all, with her own cats’ names — Meredith Grey, Benjamin Button and Olivia Benson — up 16%, 18% and 58%, respectively. Other singers that impacted the list of trending dog names were Harry, Elvis and Willie. Box office hit Barbie was up 34% for dogs, while her portrayer, Margot Robbie, got some love with Margot up 12% among cats in 2023. Marvel fans showed their devotion by naming their pets everything from Viper, Thanos, Mystique, Pyro, Coulson, Groot and Fury. However, Rocket, Loki and Peter Parker were down in 2023 — odd given the success of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and the recent return of Season 2 of the Tom Hiddleston series. Netflix’s hit show Wednesday provided fodder for dogs, up 49%, while Gomez was also trending, up 191%. Wednesday’s pal Enid and mother Morticia also made the list for the first time. Cat parents, it seems, are bigger fans of Star Wars with Ahsoka up 573%, Mando up 473%, and Luke up 90%. For dogs, Grogu is up 91%. Cat parents love them some Pedro Pascal, with everyone’s favourite daddy inspiring Pedro to move up 23% and Pascal a whopping 473%. “The names we give to our pets reflect what’s happening in the world around us, from trending TV shows, important public figures and even American football players,” Jaffe said. “And 11 years into the campaign, this trend is still going strong.”",entertainment,canada,0.4789325842696629,712,26,27.384615384615383,70.668

Noa Marciano reportedly turned 19 while in Hamas captivity on October 12. A statement from the army called Marciano ""a fallen IDF soldier abducted by a terror organisation,"" a day after the army confirmed her identity following the release by Hamas of a video showing the young woman in captivity. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. On Monday, Hamas's military wing issued a video of Marciano identifying herself and calling on Israel to stop its bombing campaign, juxtaposed with a picture of her apparently dead. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's military wing, said Marciano was killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli army did not say how she was killed. Read | Who is Noa Marciano – Israeli Army soldier, 19, held hostage by Hamas? Marciano's death brings the number of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza since the start of the war to 47. Israel has been relentlessly bombarding the Gaza Strip since Hamas fighters carried out an October 7 attack on southern Israeli communities, the deadliest in the country's history. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks and around 240 people taken captive, according to Israeli officials. More than 11,200 people, most of them civilians and thousands of them children, have been killed in Gaza in retaliatory strikes by Israel, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

150,09:49:03,"TikTok says it does not ‘take sides’, addresses criticism over Israel and pro-Palestinian content",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/tiktok-israel-hamas-war-pro-palestinian-content-us-lawmakers-ban-3919096,"Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 SINGAPORE: TikTok said it does not ""promote"" one side of an issue over another, after some US lawmakers seeking a nationwide ban of the app argued that the platform favours pro-Palestinian content. ""Our recommendation algorithm doesn't 'take sides' and has rigorous measures in place to prevent manipulation,"" TikTok said in a blog post on Monday (Nov 13). ""Blunt comparisons of hashtags are severely flawed and misrepresentative of the activity on TikTok."" When congressional Republicans renewed their push earlier this month for the app to be banned in the United States, they noted that the number of TikTok posts with the #freepalestine hashtag was far higher than those with #standwithisrael. In a letter addressed to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Senator Josh Hawley pointed to a poll that suggests a significant number of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 find Hamas' actions justified (51 per cent). Hawley said this could be attributed to anti-Israel content on TikTok, where most young internet users get their information from. He also said the findings from the poll align with “the Chinese government’s foreign policy preferences”. TikTok, which has 150 million users in the US, is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance. Republican Mike Gallagher, in an essay for a blog called The Free Press, said TikTok was “brainwashing our youth against the country and our allies”, adding that the app carries ""rampant pro-Hamas propaganda”. Addressing the criticism, TikTok said there has been ""misinformation and mischaracterisation"" about how the platform operates, adding that hashtags are added by content creators and not the social media platform. ""Millions of people in regions such as the Middle East and South East Asia account for a significant proportion of views on hashtags. Therefore, there’s more content with #freepalestine and #standwithpalestine and more overall views,"" TikTok said in its blog post. ""It is easy to cherry-pick hashtags to support a false narrative about the platform."" According to TikTok, while #standwithisrael may be associated with fewer videos than #freepalestine, it has 68 per cent more views per video in the US, which means more people are seeing the content. Both TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, ban content promoting Hamas. TikTok said that between Oct 7 and 31, it removed more than 925,000 videos in the conflict region for violating its policies around violence, hate speech, misinformation and terrorism, including content promoting Hamas. It also noted that the difference in volume between content related to Palestine and those related to Israel is similar across platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. On Facebook, 11 million posts have been tagged with the #freepalestine hashtag, which is 39 times more than those with #standwithisrael . The pro-Palestinian hashtag is also found on 6 million posts on Instagram – many times more than the pro-Israel hashtag , according to its data. TikTok also said there has been an upward trend of Palestinian support among Americans born after 1980, citing Pew Research surveys. ""The data shows that this support is not new and was rising before TikTok was created, so it would be unrealistic to ascribe such broad sentiments to a single communications channel such as TikTok,"" said the platform.",business,singapore,0.46635367762128327,639,22,29.045454545454547,47.241
151,11:31:09,US House votes against impeachment of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/us-house-votes-against-impeachment-of-dhs-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas-101699961013580.html,"The House voted Monday to push off a Republican effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, ending for now a threat against the Cabinet secretary that has been brewing ever since Republicans took the House majority in January. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 8, 2023. REUTERS/Julia Nikhinson/File Photo(REUTERS) Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right Republican from Georgia, forced a vote on impeaching Mayorkas to the floor through a rule that allows any single member to force a snap vote on resolutions, including constitutional matters such as impeachment. Eight Republicans joined with Democrats to vote 209-201 to send her resolution to committees for possible consideration, like any other bill. They are under no obligation to do anything. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Impeachment is usually reserved for grave misconduct in office but is instead being wielded in an extraordinary effort to remove Mayorkas for his handling of the southern border. The vote and its GOP support showed a growing appetite to reach for Congress’ most powerful weapons and redefine what the Constitution means by impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Impeaching a Cabinet official for their policy decisions would be unprecedented. Greene in a floor speech Monday accused Mayorkas of a “pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of the United States,” as she cited record numbers of illegal border crossings, an influx of drugs and his “open border policies.” The impeachment resolution accuses him of failing to adhere to his oath to “defend and secure our country and uphold the Constitution.” After the vote, Greene said she may try again to push an impeachment vote to the floor and argued her colleagues would face pressure from voters to impeach Mayorkas. ""Many Republicans, I would argue, are really tone deaf to their constituents and to their voters,” she said. Several prominent Republicans have become outspoken advocates of pushing forward on the GOP’s longstanding effort to impeach Mayorkas. House GOP whip Tom Emmer, the No. 3 House Republican, as well as Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican whose congressional district runs along the border with Mexico, voiced support for Greene’s resolution. During congressional testimony, Mayorkas has insisted that he is focused on securing the border and enforcing the law. “While the House Majority has wasted months trying to score points with baseless attacks, Secretary Mayorkas has been doing his job and working to keep Americans safe,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. Greene's resolution also calls the influx of migrants an “invasion."" Immigration advocates denounced her use of the term, saying it showed she was acting based on the racist “great replacement theory,” which purports that there is a plot to diminish the influence of white people in society. “Rep. Greene’s impeachment articles are a dangerous and racist political stunt and should be voted down by all of her colleagues in the House, regardless of their opinions on the policy actions of the Biden administration,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, in a statement. Republicans have closely scrutinized the Biden administration's handling of the border with Mexico for months and sought to build an impeachment case against Mayorkas. But Greene voiced frustration with the progress of those inquiries and pointed to a car crash in Texas that killed eight people after a driver suspected of smuggling people tried to flee the police and crashed into another vehicle. The renewed push to impeach Mayorkas is yet another headache for new House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is already juggling both a potential impeachment vote and delicate negotiations over government funding legislation to avert a federal shutdown at the end of the week. Johnson earlier this month said in a Fox News interview that he believed Mayorkas has committed “impeachable offenses,” but also warned that the House has “limited time and resources.” The speaker, who is just three weeks into his job, has also been supportive of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Only one U.S. cabinet official has ever been impeached: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. A House investigation found evidence that he had received kickback payments while administering government contracts. ""Exciting news!

152,19:24:06,I Survived the Holocaust. It's Starting to Feel Like the 1930s Again | Opinion,https://www.newsweek.com/i-survived-holocaust-its-starting-feel-like-1930s-again-opinion-1843328,"Last week marked the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a two-day pogrom across Nazi-occupied Europe that killed and dispossessed thousands of Jews. As a Holocaust survivor, this day is typically characterized by feelings of sorrow followed by hope around the West's long-time commitment to the doctrine of ""Never Again."" This year's commemoration, however, had a starkly different mood. In fact, attacks on Jews and Jewish spaces over the past month have me wondering if we've reverted to 1938. The evidence is bone chilling. On Oct. 18, a synagogue in was firebombed. The same thing was attempted at a synagogue in last week. In the city of Al Hammah, hundreds of rioters burned a historic temple to the ground just hours after Hamas asserted that Israel bombed a hospital in Gaza—a report that was later proven false. The damage doesn't end there. On Nov. 5, a 69-year-old Jewish man from died of complications from a head injury sustained in an altercation during a pro-Israel rally. The previous day in France, an assailant stabbed a and spray painted a swastika on her door. Three days prior to that, authorities in Los Angeles a man after he threatened to kill a Jewish family in their home. Meanwhile, antisemitic activity on has ratcheted up significantly. at Cooper Union in New York City had to shelter in a school library as protesters banged on the locked doors. At both and , anti-Zionist and antisemitic slogans were illuminated on the sides of campus buildings. And just days following Hamas' barbaric attack on Israel, 34 student groups signed a joint letter holding the Israeli regime ""entirely responsible for all unfolding violence."" It's difficult to say exactly who or what to blame for all of this. Ostensibly, there has been support for Israel and the Jewish people, at least among celebrities and elected officials. Two weeks ago, comedian gave a powerful of Israel on his weekly talk show. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Pine, Debra Messing, and Ryan Murphy signed an open letter in support of Israel. Likewise, American politicians have, for the most part, been relatively good on this issue. Last month, the House of Representatives passed a condemning the Oct. 7 attack and reaffirming U.S. support for Israel in its war against Hamas. And last week, Sen. (D-PA) boldly an Israeli flag at protesters who were demanding a ceasefire. The issue, it seems, is a very small—but very loud—minority of public figures whose words and actions are driving this spate of anti-Jewish violence. Just look at which members of decided not to sign the House resolution: Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), (D-NY), (D-MO), (D-MN), and (D-NY). Tlaib has been the worst offender of the group. Not only did she lie about who was responsible for the Oct. 17 Gaza hospital bombing while issuing no correction or clarification for her followers, she the popular antisemitic slogan ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" calling it an ""aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence."" Even if I wanted to believe her, this is not what it means to Hamas, whose charter lays out its intention to kill all Jews and dissolve the state of Israel—where I currently live—from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. In their deceit, Tlaib et al. repeat antisemitic dog whistles, ramp up the most militant instincts of their supporters, and prey on the good will of a large segment of people who genuinely want peace in the region. Either way, this manipulation has harmful, and often deadly, consequences for Jews worldwide. As if all this wasn't bad enough, there has been a sizable cohort of high-ranking politicians and world leaders in recent days making public calls for a ceasefire. Chief among them is French President who, in an interview with this weekend, on Israel to stop bombing Gaza. If I had the opportunity to speak with Macron today, I would ask him if he believed that a ceasefire would lead to an end to any and all attacks on Israel. There is ample evidence from the last few weeks that the only result of a ceasefire would be to hand Hamas the gift of more time. Time to reorganize, time to use the Palestinian people of Gaza as human shields, and time to rearm to continue their murderous agenda. This leaves Jews with two choices that no one would envy. Fight back in any way we can or march like sheep to the slaughter.

154,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be? Stars of David painted on a wall in Paris on October 31. French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid….

And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

155,11:30:25,Morning Report — Democrats open to Speaker’s funding fallback,https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/4308412-democrats-open-to-speakers-funding-fallback/,"Whew. A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday. He called it “far from perfect” but said the proposal could work ( ). Under the two-track temporary compromise, the House would extend funding for military construction, veterans’ benefits, transportation, housing, urban development, agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and energy and water programs through Jan. 19. Funding for all other federal operations, including defense, would expire on Feb. 2. are elements of ’s request to Congress for a total of $105 billion in supplemental funding to assist Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security. The president asked for $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion in help for Israel (including $9.15 billion in humanitarian aid), $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the region and $13.6 billion to bolster the U.S. border with Mexico.

DeSantis stands as Haley’s strongest competition for her party’s second-place slot, although the Florida governor’s campaign has shown signs of financial strain following a tumultuous summer ( ). As the number of 2024 GOP primary candidates dwindles, fresh questions are emerging about the race in the leadup to the Iowa caucuses. about the winnowing GOP field, including whether Haley can overtake DeSantis, and whether former New Jersey Gov. (R) will stay in the race after Sen. (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that he was suspending his campaign. DeSantis’s campaign is moving three of its top officials to Iowa this week, a move that comes as the governor is increasingly staking his hopes on a strong performance in the GOP’s first nominating contest. His allied super PAC, Never Back Down, has invested substantial resources in the state, hoping that a strong performance there will catapult him into contention. The candidate himself has devoted a major amount of his time to Iowa too; his campaign said DeSantis has visited 92 of the state’s 99 counties. He also recently won the endorsement of Gov.

Trump’s defense team began presenting its case Monday, with co-defendant testifying in glowing terms about the company’s properties. Trump Jr. testified two weeks ago as James’s lawyers presented their case, distancing himself from the organization’s financial statements. On Monday, he was not asked about the financial statements and instead focused on touting various Trump locales. The remarks appeared aimed at bolstering the defense’s argument that the asset valuations on financial statements were not false but, instead, reflected the properties’ real values ( ). Trump’s legal team asked a federal judge to televise his election obstruction trial, echoing media outlets that argue the American public should be able to watch the case in real time.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects roughly 100,000 Americans, most of whom are Black. The disease causes red blood cells to become sickle or c-shaped, clumping together and clogging blood vessels, causing pain and other complications. There is only one approved treatment that can cure sickle cell disease: a bone marrow transplant, for which finding a compatible donor can be difficult.

156,12:32:05,Church in Jerusalem welcomes new consecrated member,https://tdpelmedia.com/church-in-jerusalem-welcomes-new-consecrated-member/,"The sole commitment these consecrated women make is the “resolution of chastity,” which they express during the Rite of Consecration. The only symbol they wear is a ring, emphasizing the spousal character of this vocation, which reflects the mystery of the Church as “Bride of Christ.” Engraved in Ruiz’s ring is an inscription in Hebrew meaning “O my ,” referring to Christ, and the date of her consecration. Women who consecrate themselves in the Ordo Virginum support themselves through their jobs. Ruiz is an iconographer and has been working for the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem for four years. She was drawn into a project aimed at renewing liturgical books — the Missal and the Evangeliary — her artwork. “I first approached iconographic art when I was a nun. It was first of all a spiritual journey, a path of prayer. More than an artistic expression, an icon is a profession of faith. Before beginning the work, I invoke the Holy Spirit and ask for forgiveness for my own sins and for those who will venerate these images. I was interested in this dimension of relationship,” Ruiz shared. She spent a year researching the style and colors. “The patriarch asked me to create something would speak to local Christians, who are Latin by tradition but Eastern by culture. A style that was uniquely mine yet rich in the entire iconographic tradition of the Church of Jerusalem. The art of Armenian manuscripts certainly had a significant influence on me.” The patriarch takes a personal interest in overseeing Ruiz’s work. “We read the Gospel together and choose which scenes to represent, taking into account the particularity of each evangelist. He particularly enjoys highlighting passages that are less frequently represented in the artistic tradition. This is a project close to his heart,” she told CNA. Currently, Ruíz is in the process of creating images for the Gospels of Matthew and Mark. “The process is very laborious and involves multiple stages for each page: the pencil lettering, the crafting of the icons, then the ink lettering and finally the gilding.” The plan is for a volume of about 200 pages with 250 images. “Making this work in Jerusalem has a special value: I can visit the places where that Gospel was lived” but also “immerse myself in Jewish culture,” she said. “This has opened my eyes to the richness that Judaism brings to Christianity. is a perfect continuity and at the same time an unprecedented newness in the person of Christ.” Ruiz learned the local languages — Arabic and Hebrew. The Mass of her consecration brought together within one place all the diverse “souls” of the Jerusalem Church: priests, friars, religious, and laity, Arab Christians and Hebrew-speaking Christians, each hearing the word of God in their own language. were migrants, foreigners, Jews, and Christians of various denominations. “I believe my being a foreigner is a blessing for this Church,” Ruiz said. “Why were there such different people in the church that day? Because I am neither Arab nor Jewish, and this allows me to bring both of these peoples into my heart together. In the praise of God we were one people, transcending the divisions that usually separate us. The Church in Jerusalem also needs this, to remember its universal vocation.” With her consecration, Ruiz embarks on her new journey as a “living stone” of the Jerusalem Church: “I am certain that I am finally in the right place. It is not an act of heroism. I am simply where God wants me to be.”",top,nigeria,0.4595375722543353,692,36,19.22222222222222,65.555

158,13:13:20,Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?,https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/,"has as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”—America’s elite, university-educated Blacks—tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother. “We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean. I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers—especially strong Black feminists—whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, , a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel . Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too. By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.” Stories abounded in my family about W. E. B. Du Bois, whose essay collection stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America. “Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.” being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school—you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too. So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks—and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa? This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “ , Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen. Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate. I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration—that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn? there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa. Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC. Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.” In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published , a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors—a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks. These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent. Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan. Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced—the HIV/AIDS pandemic—drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone? Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette? This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, . Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land? humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen—90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. . Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.” I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus—an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives—have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.” Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa? AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.” Another relative—Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn—had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties. “I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.” Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver—a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob—wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.” His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate. “If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.” Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things—which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.” When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum—another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora—how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt. “I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’” acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.” “Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.” Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared. On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US. Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries—Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.” For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well. More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa. One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation—including Melva Black—back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center. For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance. Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work—and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups—is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule. no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice. With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway. We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now. Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us. Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa. We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora. It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action. In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men. . . . Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself—or appealing to others—to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling.",top,canada,0.30127041742286753,5510,234,23.54700854700855,56.679

A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday. He called it “far from perfect” but said the proposal could work ( ). Under the two-track temporary compromise, the House would extend funding for military construction, veterans’ benefits, transportation, housing, urban development, agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and energy and water programs through Jan. 19. Funding for all other federal operations, including defense, would expire on Feb. 2. are elements of ’s request to Congress for a total of $105 billion in supplemental funding to assist Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security. The president asked for $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion in help for Israel (including $9.15 billion in humanitarian aid), $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the region and $13.6 billion to bolster the U.S. border with Mexico.

Haley’s move comes as she fights to emerge as the clear alternative to former to represent the GOP against Biden next fall. DeSantis stands as Haley’s strongest competition for her party’s second-place slot, although the Florida governor’s campaign has shown signs of financial strain following a tumultuous summer ( ). As the number of 2024 GOP primary candidates dwindles, fresh questions are emerging about the race in the leadup to the Iowa caucuses. about the winnowing GOP field, including whether Haley can overtake DeSantis, and whether former New Jersey Gov. (R) will stay in the race after Sen. (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that he was suspending his campaign. DeSantis’s campaign is moving three of its top officials to Iowa this week, a move that comes as the governor is increasingly staking his hopes on a strong performance in the GOP’s first nominating contest. His allied super PAC, Never Back Down, has invested substantial resources in the state, hoping that a strong performance there will catapult him into contention. The candidate himself has devoted a major amount of his time to Iowa too; his campaign said DeSantis has visited 92 of the state’s 99 counties. He also recently won the endorsement of Gov.

Trump’s defense team began presenting its case Monday, with co-defendant testifying in glowing terms about the company’s properties. Trump Jr. testified two weeks ago as James’s lawyers presented their case, distancing himself from the organization’s financial statements. On Monday, he was not asked about the financial statements and instead focused on touting various Trump locales. The remarks appeared aimed at bolstering the defense’s argument that the asset valuations on financial statements were not false but, instead, reflected the properties’ real values ( ). Trump’s legal team asked a federal judge to televise his election obstruction trial, echoing media outlets that argue the American public should be able to watch the case in real time.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects roughly 100,000 Americans, most of whom are Black. The disease causes red blood cells to become sickle or c-shaped, clumping together and clogging blood vessels, causing pain and other complications. There is only one approved treatment that can cure sickle cell disease: a bone marrow transplant, for which finding a compatible donor can be difficult. The new treatment, known as exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), takes a patient’s own stem cells and edits them to produce more fetal hemoglobin, an abundance of which has been observed to cause red blood cells to not “sickle” ( ). 🇨🇳 Flashback: Chinese President , 70, this week makes his 10th trip to the United States and his fifth as China’s top leader.

160,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

162,09:31:53,Palestinian children in the West Bank are also under attack,https://turks.us/palestinian-children-in-the-west-bank-are-also-under-attack/,"While the world’s focus is on Israel’s genocidal siege and bombing campaign in Gaza, Israel is also inflicting terror on Palestinians across the occupied West Bank. At least 186 people, including more than 30 children, have been killed there by the Israeli military and settlers since October 7. And nowhere in the occupied territories has seen more military aggression than the Jenin refugee camp, which to all intents and purposes has become a warzone. Since 2018, the Brighton Trust, an English charity that I am part of, has been helping fund the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre in the camp. It is a place where children can go to learn, play and socialise. In recent weeks, many have sought refuge from Israeli bombing in the Centre, and have been sleeping there because their homes have been destroyed. Like every corner of the overpopulated camp, the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre is currently under attack. In fact, it has been under attack for a long time. In July this year, during their violent incursion into Jenin which killed 12 Palestinians, Israeli soldiers also raided the Centre and wrecked it. They not only destroyed all facilities and equipment, including children’s books, but also punched large holes into the exterior walls of the building, leaving it barely habitable. Our charity, together with the British Shalom-Salaam Trust, had to raise money to repair the building and replace equipment. Children eventually returned to the Centre, but it was clear that they were not safe there. The Israeli military was determined not to allow Palestinians in Jenin to have peace and quiet, even at a centre for children. And things got significantly worse since Israel responded to Hamas’s October 7 attack with a genocidal bombing campaign in Gaza and increasingly aggressive and deadly military operations across the West Bank. A teacher at the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre wrote to me in mid-October about the horrific situation Jenin’s children have been in since the July incursion. “We did not have one peaceful night since [July],” she explained. “When the attacks on the Gaza Strip started, the attacks on the camp became even worse. Life got so hard that it feels like we can’t breathe. The soldiers are threatening that they will do the same to us in Jenin, as they are doing to people in Gaza. Actually, they have already started doing it, but the world is too busy elsewhere, showing only the Israeli side of the story. We have only one wish today. To have just one peaceful night, without waking up with the news that a family member or an entire family got killed.” She went on to tell me about the night soldiers entered her home and detained her family for hours as they tried to capture someone in the area. “They locked us up for three hours in the bathroom,” she said. “Even my brother’s baby, who is only 15 days old, was not allowed to get milk. These things start to feel normal here, but all the children are dying from inside. They don’t understand why this is happening. We are screaming, but no one hears us.” The same teacher wrote to me once again on October 27. “Each night we lose people, children. We buried lots, but because they die after the attack, the news never mentions them! Even our cemetery was bombed.” “Our Centre is in the middle of camp, the only lovely place for children. It is now very dangerous to reach, but the children find it the only place that can help them survive. I can’t tell them we are really in danger [at the centre]!” The media only talks about the Gaza Strip. But in the West Bank, the situation is very bad as well. Cities, villages and camps are all locked down and under near-constant attack. And everyone, including thousands of children, is at risk and suffering. Israel’s excuse for its murder and maiming of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in the Gaza Strip is that it is trying to “destroy Hamas”. In the West Bank, Hamas is not in power, yet Israel is increasing the repression and the violence. It is doing so because its real objective, in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, is not “destroying Hamas” or defeating any other enemy. Its true goal is, and has always been, ethnic cleansing. As we’ve already seen in a leaked Ministry of Intelligence document, Israel desires to annex the whole of Gaza and expel its population into the Sinai desert. The same is true in the West Bank even if, so far, the means of expelling the Indigenous population are not the same. Large areas of the West Bank had already been made Arabrein (“free of Arabs”) through the use of settler and army terror and pogroms before October 7. But in the last month, there has been an acceleration in Palestinians being forced out of their villages and homes. On October 28, the Palestinian community of in the South Hebron Hills had to pack up and leave their lands due to settler terror. This was just one of the eight communities that have been forced to abandon their homes and lands in the past four weeks. Six others have been partially evacuated after villagers have been told they will be killed if they refuse to leave. This is a pattern we have seen before. First, Palestinians in rural areas will be forced to leave their land and move into cities. Then, those in the cities will be pushed out into a third country. Israel has embarked on a second Nakba – not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. On November 9, there was yet another attack on Jenin, the most serious yet. 14 Palestinians were murdered, mostly by drones. During the attack, Al Tafawk Centre was tear gassed with the children still inside it and, according to some reports we received, live ammunition was used. Most of the children were evacuated, but about 20, owing to the inhalation of gas, were unable to. Later the same day, the teacher I’ve been in contact with risked her own life and went into the Centre to check up on the children. She found some of the children unconscious. It beggars belief how a children’s centre has become the object of a military attack unless the real goal is to destroy all Palestinian civil society organisations. On November 13, we received a distressing message from the Centre’s head teacher whose father has been arrested and beaten. She told us the Centre is barely operating because of the attacks of the Israeli army. People have no food, and many of the children don’t know what has happened to their families. The Al Tafawk Children’s Centre, and the Palestinian children trying to find peace and safety there, are now under attack. Like others in the Jenin camp, across the occupied West Bank, and in Gaza, they are being targeted, threatened and traumatised for the crime of being Palestinian, and trying to exist in their ancestral lands. They are telling us that “they cannot breathe”. That they are screaming, but no one is listening. The world cannot continue to ignore their plight. We have to help the children of Gaza, and the West Bank. We have to demand an immediate end to Israel’s brutal ethnic cleansing campaign.",world,turkey,0.34898388227049754,1427,71,20.098591549295776,73.897
163,08:33:10,Old Clip of Palestinian Child and Activist’s Arrest by Israelis Shared as Recent,https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/old-video-of-palestinian-child-and-activist-arrested-shared-as-recent-fact-check,"A video showing uniformed and armed men taking away a boy and a man is being shared on social media platforms. What is the claim?: Users have written that it shows a Palestinian father and child being taken away by Israeli forces. An archive of the post can be found here . (Source: X/Screenshot) This post recorded three million views at the time of writing this story. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here .) Is it true?: This claim is false. The video dates back to 2015 and shows Israeli forces arresting the head of board members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee (PSCC) and activist Munther Amira and a 6-year-old child, Abdallah Lutfi Yousef from Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem. Also Read Fact-Check: Altered Image Passed Off as Actor Gal Gadot Condemning Israel ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD How did we find out?: We divided the viral video into several keyframes and ran a Google reverse image search on some. We found the same video on a Facebook page named Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, which was uploaded on 17 November 2015 . The PSCC is a grassroots formation community-based resistance group spreading Palestine's cause in a non-violent manner. It was uploaded with a caption that read: ""Israeli occupation forces arrest of activist, and head of board members, of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, Munther Amira, and 6-year-old child, Abdallah Lutfi Yousef from Aida refugee camp."" Taking a cue from this, we ran a relevant keyword search and found news reports by RT and PNN Network that also dated back to 2015. RT reported on 18 November 2015 that the video was uploaded by the PSCC showed Israeli forces at the Aida refugee camp, near the West Bank city of Bethlehem , forcefully detaining two people, including a small boy. Similarly PNN's story from 17 November 2015 noted that the child was released after an hour due to the pressure from the ""Palestine's military liason and Amira was transferred to an unknown place."" Here is a preview of the report. This page has been translated from Arabic to English. (Source: PNN/Screenshot) Conclusion: Clearly the viral claim is false. The video is old from 2015 and shows an activist and child being taken away by Israeli forces unlike a father and son as claimed.

164,07:31:08,"US business leaders to pay $40,000 for a table of eight for dinner with Xi Jinping",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-thousand-of-dollars-dinner-china-xi-jinping-visit-united-states-joe-biden-101699946570663.html,"Top business leaders in the United States are expected to dine with Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco on Wednesday as he seeks to court American companies and counter his country's recent struggles to entice foreign investment. Xi, who is widely expected to deliver a speech, will be eager to convince US industry that China is still open for business after recording its first quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. (File) The dinner on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will follow a day of talks between Xi and US President Joe Biden, aimed at stabilizing fraught ties between the world's two largest economies. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. For American businesses, it will be a chance to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate China's economic slowdown, a US push to ""de-risk"" some American supply chains away from China, and uncertainty caused by expanding Chinese security rules. ""The purpose of the dinner is to foster better communication,"" one source close to the organizers told Reuters, declining to say who would speak while confirming representatives from both the Chinese and US governments would share the podium. But the event, yet to be formally announced by hosts US-China Business Council (USCBC) and the National Committee on US-China Relations (NCUSCR), also presents uneasy optics. According to event notifications seen by Reuters, some US firms will pay tens of thousands of dollars to hear a ""Chinese state leader"" from a government that Washington has accused of genocide against Muslim Uyghurs. China has vigorously denied the accusations. The USCBC and NCUSCR both declined to comment on the planned dinner. China's embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Xi, who is widely expected to deliver a speech, will be eager to convince US industry that China is still open for business after recording its first quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment. Even as China this year cast off COVID-19 pandemic controls that effectively shut its borders, it has grown more suspicious of engagement with Western companies, in line with Xi's emphasis on national security. Xi has overseen a crackdown on US consultancy and due-diligence firms, a further blow to investor confidence. 'FILET MIGNON' AND HUMAN RIGHTS For decades, business and trade has been at the center of US-China relations, helping to fuel China's explosive economic resurgence and offering what Beijing has often described as the ballast in otherwise contentious ties. But concerns about a new style cold war between the rival economic and geopolitical superpowers has increasingly placed companies in the cross hairs of both governments. Xi is on his first visit to the US in more than six years and the pricey dinner, up to $40,000 for a table of eight, according to one notice for the event, is routine by standards for past Chinese presidential visits. Reuters was not able to obtain a list of attendees, but executives of some companies who spoke privately to Reuters said they would steer clear given questions about the utility for their operations in China and US political risks. Jeff Moon, a former US trade official turned business adviser, said China's goal would be to soften Xi's image and attract investment, but that the dinner was unlikely to ""move any needles."" US lawmakers have castigated some American businesses for turning a blind eye to allegations of forced labor in China and some have been scathing in their criticism of the event. ""How does that dinner conversation go? 'Wow, this filet mignon is a little dry. How's your extrajudicial internment of over a million Uyghur Muslims going?"" said Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representative's select committee on China. Despite human rights concerns, Biden has made a diplomatic push to improve relations, which slid to what many analysts viewed as an all-time low after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February. The Biden administration says communication at the highest level is essential to prevent competition veering into conflict, and in the interest of the global economy too. Biden's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated ahead of the APEC summit that while the US sought to reduce its dependence on China in some areas, it did not seek broad economic decoupling. The dinner is Xi's ""reassurance tour,"" and business leaders would look to him to set expectations for how foreign companies would be treated in China, said Nirav Patel, chief executive of consultancy The Asia Group. ""They have come to accept that there's no substitute for hearing and seeing and observing what Xi Jinping is doing,"" said Patel. “Of course, there are some that want to be able to demonstrate that they are committed to China and their presence in these meetings demonstrates that.” ""Exciting news!

165,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be? Stars of David painted on a wall in Paris on October 31. French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

Around 4,000 people have been forced from their homes in the town of Grindavik due to its proximity to the Fagradalsfjall volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula, while the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction has been closed. For many locals, the episode has revived the trauma of the disastrous explosion at another of Iceland's volcanoes, Eyjafjallajokull, back in 2010. While the eruption didn't kill anyone, it did produce a huge cloud of ash that prompted the biggest global aviation shutdown since World War II . Now, scientists have revealed to MailOnline just how big an eruption could be and if it could rival Eyjafjallajokull, which saw 50,000 flights cancelled and 8million passengers affected.

'A potential future eruption arising from the current unrest will not lead to disruption like that of the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption,' he said. 'Eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula are dominated by basalt lava production with only minor ash production, whereas the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption was dominated by ash production. 'So it is extremely unlikely that an eruption arising from the current unrest will cause disruption to transatlantic air travel.' Although Iceland's capital Reykjavik is well outside the danger zone, Iceland's airport of Keflavík lies around 10 miles (17 km) northwest of the area of unrest. At the moment, flights are departing and arriving at Keflavik – Iceland's primary international airport – as usual. However, as a precaution for domestic and international air travel, the volcanic aviation colour code for the Reykjanes Peninsula is now orange (heightened unrest). The orange alert represents the third-highest level, although it poses limited hazards to aviation. The next stage is red, reserved for an imminent or ongoing volcanic eruption that could seriously affect aviation, but this is unlikely.

The mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava. MAR forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> Advertisement Iceland is a particular hotspot for seismic activity because it sits on a tectonic plate boundary called the Mid Atlantic Ridge. The Mid Atlantic Ridge is a long chain of mountains that stretches down the Atlantic ocean, meaning most of these mountains are underground. It's gradually pushing North America and Eurasia away from each other . There are only a few places on Earth where the Mid Atlantic Ridge is exposed on land, but Iceland – which is slap bang in the middle of the ridge – is one of them. But Iceland is also located over a mantle plume – a column of hot, molten rock that rises from the deep mantle to the surface, becoming lava when it erupts. In the past week, Grindavik has become lined with massive cracks in the land that are billowing out steam – the result of magma moving underground that pushes up on the Earth's crust. Authorities are fearing eruptions of basalt lava – viscous molten rock – that comes to the surface in the region through the cracks right underneath buildings. Dr Carmen Solana, a volcanologist at the University of Portsmouth, said magma is very close to the surface' – around 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 miles) – and an eruption could occur 'at any time'. Large cracks appear on a road amid volcanic activity near Grindavik in Iceland. Experts fear houses could collapse or lava could come from them Map shows the tectonic plates of the lithosphere (the rocky outermost shell) on Earth.

Residents have been evacuated because of the concern that cracks could 'open literally underneath houses', she said, leading to 'complete destruction' of Grindavik which is a key part of the country's fishing industry. Dr Solana agreed that an imminent eruption would not cause similar travel disruption like that of the 2010 eruption. 'Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 was actually a small eruption but it happened on a volcano underneath an ice cap,' she said. 'The interaction of magma with ice, increased the explosivity, broke the magma into very small pieces of ash that went into the atmosphere. 'This is not the scenario that we're looking at here.' Despite the build-up of activity, Dr Solana added that an eruption might not actually happen. 'At the moment we don't even know if there's going to be an eruption,' she told MailOnline. 'How much magma is going to come, we don't really know. 'There might be an accumulation of magma beneath the surface but that doesn't mean that all of that is going to come to the surface.' Professor Marc K. Reichow, a geochemistat the, University of Leicester, said it's 'difficult to say' what the potential size or scale of an eruption will be. Tourists walk on recently cooled lava from the Fagradalsfjall Volcano in southwestern Iceland back in 2021 (file photo) 'Depending whether this eruption will take place the proximity to local residences could be dangerous and cause damage to buildings,' he said. 'The area has been evacuated and hazard to life is currently minimal.' Almannavarnir, part of Iceland's Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, has a dedicated advice page that details Grindavík's evacuation plan. Residents should close windows, unplug electrical appliances and secure the home before putting a sign outside to show the house is vacated. It says: 'Residents must evacuate their homes and leave town. This is not an emergency evacuation. It is our request to the residents of Grindavík to leave the town without any trouble. 'There is no immediate danger imminent, the evacuation is primarily preventive with the safety of all Grindvíkin in the first place.' How a volcanic eruption in 2010 sparked almost a month of chaos for European air travel A volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2010 sparked the worst air travel disruption since the Second World War. Chaos descended within the European travel industry when an unfortunate series of phenomenons combined from a number of relatively small volcanic events at Eyjafjallajokull, on the south side of the island. Seismic activity had started at the end of 2009 and had intensified up until March 20, when the volcano - which is covered by an ice cap - finally erupted. The eruption was small - just one out of seven on the scale used to measure eruptions. Globally, it appeared a relatively small event at the time. But around five days later, scientists began to notice unusual activity. They found evidence at magma was flowing from underneath the crust into Eyjafjallajokull's magma chamber and that pressure stemming from the process caused a huge crustal displacement. While the eruption began as an effusive eruption - where lava runs from the volcano along the ground - the volcano then entered an explosive stage on April 14. This time, the explosion was measured as a four on the volcanic scale Meanwhile, ice surrounding the volcano started melting and began flooding into the volcano. This rapid cooling caused the magma to shear into fine and jagged ash particles. It also increased the volcano's explosive power. While the eruption began as an effusive eruption - where lava runs from the volcano along the ground - the volcano then entered an explosive stage on April 14. This time, the explosion was measured as a four on the volcanic scale. A huge ash cloud was fired into the air, reaching up to nine kilometres in height. Around 250 million cubic metres of volcanic material was also spewed into the air as a result of the explosion. To make matters worse, the volcano was directly under a jet stream and the rapid cooling from the ice water gave the volcano enough power to shoot the ash directly into it. The jet stream was also unusually stable at the time and sent ash particles from the volcano continuously southeast - towards Europe. From April 14-20, ash from the volcanic eruption covered large areas of Northern Europe. About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial jet traffic and it affected approximately 10 million travellers, with nearly 100,000 flights to and from and within Europe cancelled across the six day period. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) estimated that airports lost £80 million over the six-and-a-half days, while the knock-on disruption lasted for around a month. In the United Kingdom alone thirteen travel firms collapsed during the summer of 2010. The ash cloud disruption was cited as one of the contributing factors. A huge ash cloud was fired into the air, reaching up to nine kilometres in height. Around 250 million cubic metres of volcanic material was also spewed into the air as a result of the explosion Several sports matches were postponed, while Liverpool football club had to travel by coach to Madrid in order to play a match in the Europa League. While the travel disruption mostly ran throughout April, volcanic activity continued at Eyjafjallajokull until October, when scientists declared the eruption was over. In 2011, a volcano under the Vatnajökull glacier sent thousands of tonnes of ash into the sky in a few days, raising concerns of a repeat of the travel chaos seen across northern Europe. Though the explosion was larger than Eyjafjallajokull, the impact was not as wide-spread. A total of 900 flights (out of 90,000 in Europe) were cancelled as a result of the eruption in the period May 23-25. In 2014, Bárðarbunga erupted in what was the biggest eruption in Iceland in more than 200 years. However, only local travel was impacted as a result.

Fox founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation in 2000 in a bid to fund research to cure Parkinson's disease - a disease he was diagnosed with in 1991. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight , the Back to the Future actor reminisced about the late Friends star's generosity when the foundation was first finding its feet. Fox, 62 - who revealed his Parkinson's diagnosis in 1998 - said: 'I have to say, my preference is to be discreet, but I hope he doesn't mind. 'When they first had their big sale, whatever they did, and [the Friends cast were] all made millionaires for the rest of their lives - he wrote a big fat check to the foundation.' Old friends: Michael J Fox has revealed that Matthew Perry made a sizeable donation to his charity after signing a record-breaking contract on Friends (pictured together in 2000) Gone Too Soon: Fox spoke highly of the late actor who helped his foundation during it's earlier days, describing Perry's act as a 'tremendous vote of his confidence' (Perry pictured in 2012) Fox shared that Perry's gesture was a 'tremendous vote of his confidence', as it was still early doors for the charity. He explained that the late actor's kindness didn't come with a side of boastfulness or arrogance, adding that he loved that it was a 'Take it and do your best,' gesture. The extreme act of kindness came after Perry - alongside, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston - negotiated a ground- breaking $1 million per episode cheque on the Nineties sitcom. The Friends cast all agreed that they would walk away from the NBC if they were not all compensated equally. Perry's donation to the Parkinson's foundation did not come out of the blue, as the two Canadian-American actors spent a considerable amount of time in each others company over the years, bonding over their shared love for ice hockey. The Back to the Future actor labelled Perry - who often publicly boasted about Fox's talents - a 'funny guy', joking that he was 'happy' he 'had an impact on him'. Fox's heartwarming confession comes after Perry passed away on October 28, 2023 . He was discovered in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home, and was buried on November 3, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. His death certificate, obtained by The Blast , shows his official cause of death is being deferred pending toxicology reports, which could take weeks to determine.

Those recovering will be guided by Perry's own experiences and his passion to positively impact as many lives as possible. The Friends star detailed his own struggles with addiction in his 2022 autobiography - Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing. While he was endorsing his novel in an interview with Tom Power, the late actor raved about fellow thespian Michael J Fox. 'I was young, I had done a couple of plays in school, and Michael J. Fox was it, man,' said an enamoured Perry according to UsWeekly . 'When I was in ninth grade, Michael J. Fox had just done Back to the Future, and there was smoke coming out of my ears, I was so jealous of this guy.' Commending Fox on having the number one show - Family Ties - as well as the number one movie the time, Perry quipped: 'He was huge and I don't know anybody else who's done that — except me.'

168,07:54:38,"3 murderers freed in Australia after court ruled out holding migrants indefinitely, minister says",https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/11/14/3-murderers-freed-in-australia-after-court-ruled-out-holding-migrants-indefinitely-minister-says/,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Three murderers are among 81 foreigners recently released in Australia after the High Court ruled their indefinite detention in migrant centers was unconstitutional, the immigration minister said on Tuesday. The court hasn’t released the reasons behind its ruling last week that overturned a 2004 precedent that stateless people could be detained indefinitely. The Melbourne-based Human Rights Law Center reported last month that 127 people had been detained more than five years. The average was 709 days. Australia’s center-left government had argued against the release of the foreign and stateless detainees whom Australia does not want to resettle and other countries are reluctant to accept. Opposition lawmakers called them “hardcore criminals” and accused the government of endangering the public by releasing them. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said the released foreigners included three murderers and several sex offenders. He offered to give deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley a breakdown later of how many had been convicted of sex crimes. “The decision of the High Court which requires release effects very, very serious offenders,” Giles told Parliament. One of those convicted of murder is Sirul Azhar Umar, a former police officer who was sentenced by a Malaysian court in 2015 to be hanged over the death of a Mongolian woman whose body was dismembered with military-grade explosives. The 50-year-old had fled to Australia before he was sentenced in absentia and had been held in detention for nine years until the High Court decision last week. Australia cannot extradite anyone to a country where that person could face capital punishment. Details of the other two convicted of murder were not available. Ley highlighted the case of Afghan-born Aliyawar Yawari, whom she described as a “violent sex predator who attacks elderly women in their home.” The 65-year-old moved into a motel in the west coast city of Perth after being released from detention, The Australian newspaper reported. He was convicted of multiple offenses against three women between October 2013 and December 2014, the newspaper reported. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said the people who had been released had been subjected to stringent visa conditions and some were required to report to police daily. “Some of these people have committed disgusting crimes,” O’Neil told Parliament. “Some of them have hurt people who are still here in our country and it is those victims that we care about,” she added. The High Court case decided last week was brought by a member of Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, identified in court as NZYQ, who was convicted of raping a 10-year-old boy in Sydney and sentenced to five years in prison. He went to indefinite immigration detention after prison. Rod Mcguirk, The Associated Press",top,canada,0.5202312138728323,519,23,22.565217391304348,50.991

There's even been the occasional Macbeth along the way from a man who most agree would have been well-suited to the stage. There can be few lives more closely scrutinised than that of our new King. Yet even today as he celebrates turning 75, Charles can pull a few surprises as these glimpses of his long and eventful life make clear... Charles was born by Caesarian after a marathon labour King Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948 by Caesarean section. Here a chubby Charles is pictured with his mother in 1949 King Charles arrived at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1948, at 9.14pm, after a marathon 30-hour labour . Princess Elizabeth, then 22, gave birth via Caesarean section in a music room in Buckingham Palace, which had been converted into an operating theatre. His birth was the first of a senior royal not to be attended by a senior politician His birth was the first of a senior member of the royal family not to be attended by a senior politician – this tradition, which dated back to the 17th century, was to ensure that the newborn was a genuine descendant of the monarch. His first word was 'Nanna' The Prince of Wales, aged two, with his nurse Mabel Anderson, watching a procession in 1950 Times were very different, of course, and like other royal children of his day, Charles was surrounded by the nannies and servants of a formal nursery. Charles's first word is said to have been 'nanna', addressed nanny Mabel Anderson. Winston Churchill was impressed by the child Queen Elizabeth with Prince Charles and Princess Anne chatting to Winston Churchill in 1953 Churchill, then in his second term as Prime Minister, and his wife, Clementine, met three-year-old Charles at Balmoral estate. A rare piece of colour footage captures the moment and shows Churchill playing with a piece of driftwood as a three-year-old Prince Charles stands close by. After the visit, Churchill wrote to the Queen: 'I was keenly impressed by the development of Prince Charles as a personality. 'He is young to think so much' Charles became heir apparent at just three years old King Charles became the heir apparent - next in line to the throne - following the death of his grandfather, King George VI . His mother Queen Elizabeth acceded the throne on 6 February 1952. Charles, who attended part of the Coronation the following year, was only three. Prince Charles sits between grandmother, Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret at his mother's 1953 Coronation. He had become heir apparent the previous year on the death of his grandfather He received his own special invitation to Queen Elizabeth's coronation A four-year-old Prince Charles received his own illustrated invitation to the Coronation of his mother in 1953. The elaborate design was hand painted with soldiers playing musical instruments. It featured a lion and unicorn, with flowers and trees around the border. Prince Charles received his own illustrated invitation to the coronation of his mother in 1953 He was the first future monarch to be sent to school Prince Charles pictured walking to Cheam School in Berkshire in his school uniform in 1958 Charles was the first future monarch to be sent to school, rather than being privately by tutors at home. The decision to send Charles to a private school was a significant departure from royal tradition, in hopes that he would 'rub shoulders' with boys from a variety of backgrounds. The future King attended Hill House School in west London, before moving on to Cheam School, Berkshire, from the age of eight. He later attended Gordonstoun in Moray, Scotland. Charles's first official trip abroad was to Malta Prince Charles went to Malta when he was five years old - his first official trip abroad. The young prince and his sister, Anne, had accompanied their parents aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia. After ten days at sea, they went ashore at Malta, where they were met by Earl and Countess Mountbatten. 'Dickie' Mountbatten was Prince Philip's uncle. Charles and Anne with the Mountbattens in Malta, April 1954 - Charles' first official trip abroad The Prince was head boy King Charles has subsequently made it clear that he did not enjoy his time at Gordonstoun, a famously outdoorsy boarding school in Scotland. Even so, he was head boy - or 'Guardian' - there in his final years. Before this he was a Colour Bearer (prefect) and head of his boarding house. The Queen with a young Prince Charles on a visit to Gourdonstoun The young Prince bought cherry brandy for half a crown Charles took his first alcoholic drink in public when he was just 14 years old at the Crown Hotel in Stornoway on the island of Lewis. The young prince had been on a school trip with Gordonstoun School. Anxious to escape peering onlookers as he waited in a hotel lounge for the teacher to return, he sought refuge in the next room, which turned out to be the bar. Under-age or not, he figured that the polite thing to do was buy a drink, so paid half a crown for a cherry brandy. This was sort of drink he might have been given as a treat at home. This minor infraction was spotted however, and the story went round the world. His first Royal Engagement was at the Palace of Holyrood House Prince Charles undertook his first Royal Engagement when he was 16 years old and still studying at school. He met hundreds of young Scottish and Commonwealth students attending a garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, the late Queen's official residence in Scotland. Charles became Prince of Wales in 1958 when he was nine years old. His ceremonial investiture took place much later, however, in July 1969 when he was 20 Charles spent two terms abroad in Australia When he was a shy 17-year-old, Charles spent two terms studying abroad in Australia. Charles was a pupil at Geelong Church of England Grammar School in Victoria, about 100 miles away from Melbourne. Reflecting on his time there many years later, he said: 'I learnt an enormous amount... and discovered just how direct and friendly and straightforward and so often blunt Australians are … But with such an incredibly good sense of humour.' Charles on a guided tour of Timbertop, a rural outpost of Geelong Grammar School in February 1966 Nixon tried to set up Charles with his daughter President Nixon is said to have attempted to match up his daughter with Charles when the Prince made a short visit to the United States of America in 1970. At almost every single event the prince attended, the pair sat next to each other. But it is suggested they did not hit it off. Even Charles acknowledged the setup, reflecting on the 70s trip to Washington DC he told CNN: 'That was quite amusing, I must say. That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon.' Biographer Sally Bedell Smith, who wrote Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life, said: 'More than three decades later when Charles and his new wife, Camilla, visited George W and Laura Bush at the White House, he joked that the Bushes had better not try to fix up their twin daughters with his sons William and Harry the way Nixon had worked to set him up with Tricia.' Prince Charles claimed that President Nixon had tried to set up Prince Charles with his daughter Tricia. They were placed next to each other at official events on a visit to America Tribesmen called him 'the one who makes cows cry' While on a royal tour to Tanzania in 2011 with his wife Camilla, the pair met nomadic Maasai cattle herders. The Maasai believe they own every single cow in the world and were particularly impressed to hear that Charles keeps more than 800. So they gave him another title, Oloishiru Ingishi, meaning 'the one who makes cows cry'. According to Matthew Rimba, a village elder, the animals would cry out, or call, for their owner and helper because of the support he gives them. The awarding of the title is considered a great honour. In Maasai culture, the cow is king. How Barbra Streisand could have been a real Jewish Princess! In his younger days, King Charles was said to have been infatuated with Barbra Streisand. The pair later became good friends, with rumours circulating that they were an item. Pictured: Charles and Barbra in 1974 Charles was once said to have been 'infatuated' with Barbra Streisand. They first met in 1974. In 2021, the actress, singer and filmmaker revealed that the prince had sent her a bouquet of flowers. They started spending time together at Highgrove soon afterwards. Streisand told ITV's Lorraine: 'It was so sweet. I was recording at Warner Brothers, and he asked to meet me. 'We became friends, and I loved spending time at Highgrove and spending some time with him. 'I saw this bouquet of flowers and I said, 'Who sent me that?' and my assistant said, 'A fan called Charles'.' 'And I said, 'Really? Let me see the note' — and there was his seal. And they weren't like from a florist because they were from his gardens and it's a different look.' Later, she joked: 'You know, if I played my cards right, I could have wound up being the first Jewish princess!' The Prince of polite polo The King retired from polo when he was 57. But he was said to have been an accomplished player, a skilled rider who had learned the game from his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten The King retired from polo when he was 57. But he was said to have been an accomplished player, a skilled rider (with access to good ponies, of course) who had learned the game from his uncle Louis Mountbatten. One commentator described him as playing 'a very polite game - courteous, charming and polite on the field.' The king of tweed was named The Best Dressed Man In 2009, Esquire magazine named Charles its Best Dressed Man. Although often seen in comfortable country clothes, the Prince of Wales beat former US President Barack Obama and tennis star Roger Federer to the title. Charles is a fan of Ron Weasley's mum, Julie Walters When presenting her CBE from at Buckingham Palace in 2008, Prince Charles told actress Julie Walters what a big fan of the Harry Potter films he was When Prince Charles presented Julie Walters with her CBE at Buckingham Palace in 2008, he took the opportunity to tell the actress that he was a big fan of the Harry Potter film franchise. 'The Prince said he loved the Potters and said what great films they were and what great fun they were,' recalled the actress, who played Ron Weasley's mum in the series. 'Then I told him I'm writing my memoirs at the moment, and he said, ""oh you must have the editors constantly on"" and I said ""yes I know, constantly saying have you got it done, how much more have you written"" - so he really got into that one.' He always travels with a bag of his own blood Among many things the King takes with him on his travels is a bag of his own blood, in case an emergency transfusion is. He describes his diet as 'climatarian' The King Charles describes his diet as 'climatarian', which relies on relying on local and seasonal produce that have a reduced environmental impact. These include meals that are both plant and meat-based. Without having to cut out any one food group entirely, a climatarian diet is surprisingly one of the easiest meal plans to follow if you're thinking of changing up your day-to-day meals. Charles went on TV to warn of snow at Balmoral In 2012, Charles presented the weather forecast during a lunchtime bulletin on the BBC. The Prince of Wales, as he then was, and his wife Camilla had been visiting BBC Scotland for its 60th anniversary. The BBC weather map had been given a royal makeover for the occasion, tabbing up such landmarks as Balmoral, the Castle of Mey and Dumfries House. With this as a background, the future King was almost word-perfect with his script. 'Well it's an unsettled picture as we head towards the end of the week,' he began. 'Ahh, this afternoon it will be cold, wet and windy across most of Scotland. The rain, of course, will be heaviest over the borders and err, around Edinburgh, where it could lead to difficult conditions on the roads.' He later joked 'who the hell wrote this script' after reading out that there would be 'snow over Balmoral'. The King does not have a mobile phone It has been reported that King Charles does not have a mobile phone, and that those trying to contact him will need to do so through a member of staff. As most servants and advisers are obliged to turn their phones off in the Royal Palaces, that effectively means dialling the switchboard - or writing a letter! He likes to talk to plants and trees. And they like it, too Prince Charles is convinced that speaking to the plants helps them grow. In a 1986 interview, he said: 'I just come and talk to the plants, really – very important to talk to them. They respond.' King Charles is a keen gardener and famously talks to plants and trees. 'I just come and talk to the plants, really. Very important to talk to them,' he once said. 'They respond' Seeds for breakfast, but no lunch King Charles famously does not eat lunch, preferring to have a large breakfast to keep him going throughout the day. His former aide Julian Payne said: 'The King doesn't eat lunch; so, an early lesson I learnt when out on the road with him was to have a big breakfast or bring a few snack bars with you to keep you going. 'The working day is pretty relentless. Beginning with the radio news headlines and a breakfast of seasonal fruit salad and seeds with tea.' 'Torture in a tin' is banned Charles does not allow Foie Gras to be served anywhere in his households. He finds the making of the French delicacy, which involves force-feeding geese, particularly cruel. Some have dubbed the product 'torture in a tin'. He always brings his own seasoning to banquets Whenever Charles attends a banquet, it is said that he takes with him a silver container of Maldon sea salt, which is placed on his table, according to chef Graham Tinsley. Whenever Charles attends a banquet, it is said that he takes with him a silver container of Maldon sea salt (pictured at a traditional dinner in Japan in 1986) The King's favourite tea is Darjeeling The reigning Monarch loves drinking Darjeeling with honey and milk. Darjeeling, which is a tea grown in the Darjeeling district in West Bengal, is rich in taste and highly fragrant with a floral aroma and light-coloured infusion. This was also said to be his mother's favourite. His tea is brewed with a thermometer The former hospitality manager at Dumfries House - Charles's cultural institute in the Scottish borders - has explained how the King likes his tea to be brewed. The temperature of each pot must be taken with a thermometer, says Evan Samson. For green tea it should be exactly 70 degrees centigrade, whereas English Breakfast or Earl Grey should be brewed at 100 degrees - i.e. the water should be boiling. According to former staff, King Charles likes his tea to be brewed at exact temperatures measured by thermometer. The water poured on green tea should be at exactly 70 degrees Centigrade. English Breakfast or Earl Grey should be brewed at 100 degrees - or boiling. The King loves boiled eggs... Charles enjoys boiled eggs and is said to eat at least one every day. But suggestions that he is presented with seven boiled eggs per morning - so that he can take his pick - have been emphatically denied by the Palace. According to Graham Tinsley, who has catered for state banquets, Charles is partial to a lightly boiled or 'coddled' egg. 'Normally, a soft-boiled egg takes around five minutes,' he told Hello magazine. 'So imagine this coddled egg… it's going to be very, very soft.' ...and enjoys 'groussaka' In an interview with Country Life to mark his 70th birthday, Charles revealed that one of his favourite meals is pheasant crumble pie. He said: 'I got this recipe from someone I know. It is delicious. 'I invented a grouse one recently: coq au vin with grouse, as well as moussaka with grouse - it doesn't always have to be lamb. In other words, groussaka.' Charles even created his own organic food company Duchy Originals was set up in 1990 by Charles to sell organic food products and help small and medium sized producers It went into partnership with Waitrose in 2010 and has since changed its name to Waitrose Duchy Organic. Duchy Organic was set up in 1990 by Charles and only sells organic food products. Pictured: Charles and Camilla upon the partnership of Duchy Organic with Waitrose His Aston Martin runs on 'wine and cheese' Prince Charles's vintage sportscar runs on a fuel called bioethanol - which is made from cheese and wine. He said: 'My old Aston Martin, which I've had for 51 years, runs on - can you believe this - surplus English white wine, and whey from the cheese [making] process.' King Charles' Aston Martin is fueled bioethanol which is made out of surplus white wine and whey from the cheese process Charles and Camilla bring a bottle with them Whether touring at home or abroad, Charles and Camilla are known to bring their own bottles along. Charles's favourite alcoholic drink is gin and tonic while Camilla's is said to be red wine. Whether touring at home or abroad, Charles and Camilla are known to bring their own alcohol with them. Pictured: Charles and Camilla making mojitos at a private restaurant in Havana He sent whisky to recovering alcoholic, Ozzy Osbourne In 2003, King Charles sent a bottle of whisky to rock star Ozzy Osbourne, who was recovering from alcoholism at the time. It was intended as a 'get well soon' gift following the singer's quadbike accident.

The King sometimes starts the day with headstands According to Prince Harry, his father does half-naked headstands in the morning to overcome his aches and pains Writing in his memoir, Spare, Harry explains there was always a danger of stumbling across an upside-down Charles clad in little more than boxer shorts, while staying at Balmoral. Recommended by a physiotherapist, the exercise helps 'constant neck and back pain' resulting from old polo injuries. Charles uses a Canadian Airforce workout in the morning Quite aside from any headstands, King Charles does a 12-minute Canadian Air Force exercise plan every morning. The plan does not require any equipment and includes stretching, planks, arm circles, sit-ups, back extensions, push-ups and running on the spot. The technique was developed by Dr Bill Oban in the late 1950s and is known as the 5BX Plan (Five Basic Exercises). He has hedgehog ramps in his garden Charles has installed tiny ramps in all the fountains and ponds in his gardens so hedgehogs can escape should they fall in During a Channel 5 interview with poet Pam Ayres, Charles revealed that he helps to care for his local wildlife - specifically hedgehogs - by installing tiny ramps in all the fountains and ponds in his gardens so they can escape should they fall in. Charles broke royal tradition by attending Prince William's birth Charles broke with the long standing tradition of royal births being kept both intensely private and totally removed from involvement of the father. By encouraging Princess Diana to give birth in hospital rather than in one of the royal palaces, and remaining by her side during the birth, Charles set a modern precedent for the family. In a letter he wrote to his godmother, Patricia Brabourne, Prince Charles expressed his joy at having been present at the birth of his sons, saying: 'I am so thankful I was beside Diana's bedside the whole time because by the end of the day I really felt as though I'd shared deeply in the process of birth.'

'I remember playing in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and trying to practise in my room at Cambridge to an old record conducted by Herbert von Karajan. 'There was me sitting with my cello and my tuning fork, and I put this thing on, and of course he took it at an incredible lick – you've no idea how fast.'

King Charles is a keen mushroom forager He is a keen mushroom forager and spends a great portion of his free time in the grounds near his Scottish home of Birkhall looking for them. It has been said that at moments of great stress, he always finds respite in the natural world – and the day that his mother died was no exception. After spending a few hours with his mother, on the day she would pass away, the Prince returned to Birkhall, his nearby estate on Royal Deeside to walk in the surrounding woods, armed with a walking cane and a basket to hunt for mushrooms.

Khalifa, known for her candid views, made the controversial comparison during an appearance on the Ziwe talk show in July 2022. Mia Khalifa sparks debate with statement that being in the military is worse than being on OnlyFans. Discussing the broad spectrum of industries involving personal exposure, host Ziwe Fumudoh questioned whether there was a fundamental difference between them. ""So we have OnlyFans, and then we have the sex work industry, and then we have like actors, is there a difference between these industries or are we all fundamentally selling our bodies in some way?"" he asked. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Khalifa responded by asserting, ""Honestly, I think that selling your body, like if we are going by that definition, being in the army is worse than being on OnlyFans. You're selling your body to the government."" Reigniting the conversation more than a year later, Khalifa thrust her statement back into the spotlight by posting a TikTok video on X (formerly Twitter) on Veterans Day. The clip featured Khalifa delivering her controversial comment, seamlessly transitioning to a shot of a major sitting in a vehicle, visibly perturbed. Khalifa's post was a direct response to comedian Marcella Arguello, who reminisced, ""Who else remembers being against the Iraq war and people being like oh wow so you don't SUPPORT OUR TROOPS?!?! And then having the most dumb conversation about being anti American when you were just anti killing innocent people. Anyway, this feels like that."" The conversation also touched upon the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, adding a layer of complexity to Khalifa's remarks. Her vocal support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel's actions have stirred controversy, leading to severed ties with companies like Playboy and her dismissal from a role at Red Light Holland. Also Read | Mia Khalifa extends support to Palestine amid Hamas attack on Israel, gets blasted on social media Khalifa defended her stance, emphasizing the distinction between supporting Palestine and her business decisions. In response to her termination, she expressed regret for not scrutinizing potential ties with Zionists, acknowledging the impact on her opportunities.

172,08:30:43,Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/gaza-war-pushes-tumultuous-israel-turkey-ties-into-deep-freezer?traffic_source=rss,"The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly of Israel. Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments. “Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,” the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the , a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The vessel was trying to break Israel’s blockade and deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. It was the culmination of a sharp dive in ties since October 7. On October 20, Erdogan said Israel’s operations amounted to “genocide”. At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a “war criminal” over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas’s cross-border assault three weeks earlier. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital. But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints. By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. State-owned Turkish Airlines started direct flights to Israel in 1986. In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time. From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. Two defence agreements were signed in 1996, paving the way for a strategic military partnership that included the upgrading of F-4 and F-5 jet aircraft, M-60 tanks and helicopters. Turkey, Israel and the US participated in joint aerial and naval exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean until 2009. Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in 2002. Erdogan visited Tel Aviv as prime minister three years later, presenting himself as a possible mediator between Israelis and Palestinians. In 2004, Erdogan condemned Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as “state-sponsored terrorism”, reflecting wider Turkish support for Palestinians, and Hamas in particular. Yet, during high-level visits in 2006 and 2007, Turkey worked to resolve tensions between Syria and Israel over Syria’s involvement in Lebanon and support for Palestinian groups and Hezbollah. In 2007, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul offered to help secure the release of three captured soldiers: Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas from 2006 to 2011, and Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev who were both held by Hezbollah from 2006 until their bodies were returned to Israel in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres at the time thanked Turkey, as well as Egypt and Germany, for helping release Shalit. The three-week war on Gaza in 2008-2009 reinforced tensions between Turkey and Israel. The assault on the Turkish aid ship Mavi Marmara led to a diplomatic falling-out, which saw Ankara expel the Israeli ambassador. Official ties remained frosty until 2016 when the two countries agreed to a compensation deal and a pathway to normalising relations. But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite rekindled diplomatic tensions, business between Turkey and Israel continued to boom. Between 2010, the year of the Mavi Marmara incident, and 2021, trade volume more than doubled from $3.4bn to $8.4bn. Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last year, Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara and ambassadors were appointed in both capitals. Erdogan met Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in September and they both pledged greater cooperation between their countries. The horrors of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Erdogan’s hardening rhetoric, however, appear to have stalled those plans. Last month, he cancelled any . Early in the current war, Erdogan spoke to multiple world leaders and between Hamas and Israel. That suggestion, said Piccoli of Teneo, appeared to have evaporated in recent days.",top,united states of america,0.4310487200660611,1211,47,25.76595744680851,44.712

Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments. “Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,” the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo.

This was a more than three-fold increase compared to the whole of 2022, when 436 anti-Semitic acts or remarks were recorded. ""These are mainly tags and insults, but there are also assaults and injuries"", Darmanin added. Those acts resulted in 571 arrests, the ministry told AFP. In late October, Paris prosecutors opened an investigation into an incident when dozens of Stars of David were daubed on buildings around the city and its suburbs. France has accused Russia of interfering in its affairs by sharing photos online of the anti-Semitic graffiti. Darmanin said there had also been anti-Muslim incidents ""but they are not on the scale of what we are seeing in terms of anti-Semitism"". He said that some mosques had received threats of violence.

175,10:03:46,Pakistan: 2 soldiers killed in gun battle with terrorists in north Waziristan,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/pakistan-2-soldiers-killed-in-gun-battle-with-terrorists-in-north-waziristan-23319820,"Two soldiers lost their lives in an armed confrontation between security forces and terrorists in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan district in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats. ADVERTISEMENT This incident follows a recent terrorist attack on police personnel in Tank, where three officers, including an SHO, were killed, and several others were injured. The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed numerous fatalities and injuries, primarily concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, accounting for the majority of attacks and counter-terror operations during this period. Recently, at least nine people, including five children, of the same family were killed when a rocket launcher's shell exploded at a house while the kids were playing with the ammunition in 's Sindh province, police said. Nine individuals were killed when a rocket shell they found while playing on the ground burst at home, according to Kashmore-Kandhkot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Rohil Khosa. The victims included five children, two women, and two adults from the same household, stated a report in agencies. In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital. ""This is an area on the riverine belt and the rocket shell must have been left there by dacoits who hide out deep into the riverine belt areas,"" Khoso stated. According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status. Former foreign minister and chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari tweeted that several criminal gangs have found refuge in the riverine areas of Sindh and Punjab and urged the government to rid the area of such individuals.",world,india,0.5236139630390144,487,18,27.055555555555557,41.92
176,09:41:32,Meet the Victorian winners of the Australian of the Year awards for 2024,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-14/victorian-australian-of-the-year-2024-winners-announced/103104870,"Narungga Kaurna woman Janine Mohamed, a pioneer for Indigenous healthcare, has been named Victoria's 2024 Australian of the Year. Ms Mohamed has dedicated her life to improving health outcomes for Australia's Indigenous community, having spent the last five years as CEO of the Lowitja Institute — an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-led community health research organisation based in Melbourne. Before that, she was CEO of the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives. While she refers to herself as an ""accidental CEO"", her experience suggests otherwise — Ms Mohamed has worked for 25 years in nursing, health policy and Indigenous health and wellbeing research. She is now an adjunct professor and an alumni of the year at her alma mater, the University of South Australia, and in 2020 Edith Cowan University awarded her an honorary doctorate in nursing. Ms Mohamed has spoken about her aim to close the gap in Indigenous health outcomes by dismantling racism, expanding opportunities for Indigenous health workers, and promoting cultural safety. For her 40 years of service to animal rights advocacy, Glenys Oogjes has been awarded the Senior of the Year for Victoria. Ms Oogjes was one of the leaders of the 2004 Australian Animal Welfare Strategy, and the recent Australian Animal Welfare Standards for Poultry, which will see battery cages phased out across the country. She is now the CEO of Animals Australia, where she started in 1983 as its only employee, and is a board member of the World Federation for Animals, where she works with her international peers promoting animal justice. Bhakta Bahadur Bhattarai, also known as Durga, has been named Victoria's Young Australian of the Year through his work celebrating and supporting Albury-Wodonga's multicultural community. But his achievements came from feeling a sense of loneliness and isolation. Durga grew up in a Bhutanese refugee camp in Nepal, and migrated to Australia with his family in 2012. After finishing high school, he studied to be a pharmacy assistant and registered nurse. He found study isolating, which led him to create Albury Wodonga Multicultural Community Events Inc in 2014. The organisation has blossomed to not only celebrate multiculturism in the northern Victorian regional city, but to provide support for locals during hard times, such as supplying masks and emergency food relief during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Victoria's Local Hero Betul Tuna is a Turkish Muslim-Australian who was born and raised on Yorta Yorta Country in Victoria's north-east, and has dedicated her life to helping her community both here and abroad. In the last couple of years, she has helped coordinate emergency responses for her community affected by the 2022 floods, and the 2023 earthquake in Turkey. She has co-founded culturally safe spaces for regional Victorians to express themselves and create connections, such as the Hijack'd mobile food van, and the Point of Difference Studio. Ms Tuna also coordinated a state-funded program which aims to prevent violence against women in migrant and refugee communities, and created a campaign against female genital mutilation.",top,australia,0.507908611599297,569,20,28.45,39.42

178,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism.

But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

After days of heavy air strikes around Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, witnesses said tanks and armoured vehicles were metres (yards) from the besieged facility, which has become a focal point of the five-week-old war. The United Nations believes that thousands, and perhaps more than 10,000 people -- patients, staff and displaced civilians -- may be inside and unable to escape because of fierce fighting nearby. Amid reports of premature babies dying for lack of electricity and patients facing gunfire, a surgeon working for Doctors Without Borders said the situation inside the hospital had become ""very bad"". ""We don't have electricity. There's no water in the hospital. There's no food,"" said the doctor, who was not named by his organisation. ""It is inhuman."" Israel accuses Hamas fighters of using tunnels under the hospital as a command ""node"", effectively engaging the sick and injured as human shields. It is a charge that Hamas denies. Israel says it is not targeting the hospital, but has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the attacks of October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians and resulted in 240 hostages being taken back to Gaza. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's assault has already killed 11,240 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children. Israel says 46 of its troops have been killed in fighting in Gaza. Biden called on Israel to use ""less intrusive action relative to the hospital"", some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date. ""The hospital must be protected,"" he told reporters. Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner insisted Al-Shifa was ""central in Hamas's command and control capabilities"", but said troops were currently ""stand-offish"". ""The idea is to try to evacuate the people, evacuate as many as possible,"" he said. Underscoring the role that global public opinion is playing in the war, both sides have repeatedly given vastly different accounts of events. Lerner put the number of people inside the hospital at ""a few hundred"", while the Hamas government's deputy health minister Youssef Abu Rish, who is present in the hospital, said about 20,000 displaced people had sought refuge there. Hamas's brutal attacks of October 7 and Israel's massive response have sparked protests around the world, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in the Middle East, Europe and beyond. Israel's supporters insist it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country's 75-year history -- an attack that brought painful echoes of past pogroms against the Jewish people. But Israel's critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza. International aid agencies speak of hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a rolling humanitarian catastrophe. Israel's top diplomat admitted Monday that his nation has ""two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up."" Quoted by his spokesman, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen added that Israel is working to ""broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary."" In the face of mounting pressure, Israel has agreed to daily pauses in military operations around specified humanitarian ""corridors"" to allow Gazans to flee fighting. Israeli leaders have so far insisted there will be no broader ceasefire before hostages are released. But Qatar is mediating talks on a possible deal to free the hostages. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's military wing, said Monday that a possible deal would involve the release 100 Israeli hostages in return for 200 Palestinian children and 75 women held in Israeli prisons. ""We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce... and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,"" Abu Obeida said in an audio statement. Biden said he was ""somewhat hopeful"" the Qatar-mediated talks could lead to a deal. As security officials and diplomats continued negotiations, Hamas released a video of a young woman who was said to be an Israeli soldier held in Gaza. The Israeli army later confirmed the identity of the woman. ""Our hearts go out to the Marciano family, whose daughter, Noa, was brutally kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist organisation,"" the army said in a statement. Army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital, showing footage of a baby bottle and a rope near a chair. In the video he showed neatly arranged assault rifles, grenades and what Hagari said were ""vests with explosives"". The war in Gaza has also spurred violence on other fronts. In the northern West Bank, five Palestinians were killed in clashes around the city of Tulkarem, the director of a local hospital told AFP on Tuesday. After repeated strikes on US forces in the Middle East, the United States launched air attacks that killed at least eight pro-Iran fighters in eastern Syria, a Britain-based monitoring group said. On Monday, Israel used fighter jets to strike what it said were ""operational command centres"" belonging to Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah inside Lebanon. Fighting in Gaza AFP Relatives of Israeli hostages taken by Palestinian militants in the October 7 attack react during a demonstration calling for their release in Tel Aviv on November 13, 2023. AFP Israeli soldiers and civilians attend the funeral of Matan Meir, a member of the ""Fauda"" production team who was killed in combat while on reserve duty for the Israeli army in Gaza, on November 13, 2023 at Moshav Odem in the annexed Golan Heights. More than 11,000 people have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war erupted after Palestinian militants raided southern Israel on October 7 killing at least 1200 people, according to official Israeli figures. AFP Patients and internally displaced people are pictured at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on November 10, 2023, amid ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement. Heavy fighting was raging near Al-Shifa hospital, with Israel saying it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas's capacity to fight. AFP © Copyright AFP 2023.

Whoops!,https://www.loudersound.com/news/ffdp-ivan-moody-disturbed-david-draiman,"Being a heavy metal celebrity must be a bit of an odd experience. Most of the time, you can probably carry on with your day without getting hassled by strangers or asked for selfies in unusual places. Walk past someone in a black t-shirt with a lairy logo on it, however, and you'll at least get a surprised, delighted look or two. Head into a metal bar or a festival and you might just get mobbed. Surely, though, you'd imagine the odds of you a) getting recognised and b) getting confused for can't happen all that much. But that's exactly what happened to frontman Ivan Moody while innocently pulling up to the drive through at a fast food restaurant recently. The person serving him clearly realised that she was dealing with a heavy metal musician. As it turns out, though, it wasn't actually the one she thought. ""So I just pulled up to Taco John's, and this young lady right here just asked me if I was in a band, and I was like, 'Yes!'"" says Ivan in a video taken immediately after the encounter that he has since posted to social media. Ivan turns to the lady in the window of the fast food restaurant before adding: ""And she said I looked just like who?"" ""The lead singer from !"" replies the fast food server jovially. Yes, it turns out she thought poor Ivan was actually David Draiman, our favourite, monkey noise-making Disturbed singer. Clearly taking the whole thing in good jest, Moody turns back to the camera to send his fellow bald metal icon some appreciation: ""I love you Dave."" Watch the video for yourself below. Five Finger Death Punch's most recent album, , was released last year. Disturbed's latest album, , was also released in 2022. That's where the comparisons can end though, alright?!

182,11:41:00,How is Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron to be scrutinized by Parliament,https://en.mercopress.com/2023/11/14/how-is-foreign-secretary-lord-cameron-to-be-scrutinized-by-parliament?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_content=international&utm_campaign=rss,"The following article from BBC looks at the questions raised by the return of David Cameron to government as Foreign Secretary, and since not an elected member of the House of Commons, but rather made a peer, he will re-enter Parliament via the House of Lords, as Lord Cameron. However both opposition Labour and the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. have said the work of the new foreign secretary will be scrutinized by the Commons All government departments tend to have ministers in the House of Lords, but normally not cabinet ministers. Until 2007, the lord chancellor was always in the Lords and a member of the cabinet too. But more recently, there is normally only one peer who sits in the cabinet: the Leader of the House of Lords, currently Lord True. However, it is not unheard of for other cabinet ministers to come from the upper house. Nicky Morgan stayed on as Boris Johnson's culture secretary for several months after standing down as an MP at the 2019 election, taking the ermine and becoming Baroness Morgan in the process. The now-Lord Cameron also had a peer in his own cabinet: Baroness Warsi, who served as Tory Party chairwoman via a peerage. Gordon Brown gave Peter Mandelson a peerage so he could make his sensational 2008 cabinet comeback as business secretary (he had quit as an MP to become the UK's European commissioner). Mr Brown also made Lord Adonis his transport secretary in 2009 - with Lord Falconer and Baroness Amos serving in the cabinet of Sir Tony Blair. The last UK foreign secretary to sit in the House of Lords was Lord Carrington, who took up the role under Margaret Thatcher in 1979. He'd already been in the cabinet as a peer - he was defense secretary under Edward Heath. He resigned in as foreign secretary in 1982 after the Falkland Islands were invaded by Argentine forces, taking responsibility for the failure to predict the invasion. Lord Cameron has confirmed he will appear before MPs on Commons select committees as appropriate. But he won't be in the Commons chamber to take questions during the regular departmental scrutiny sessions that take place every five weeks. Instead, those questions will be fielded by the ministers below him at the Foreign Office, including Andrew Mitchell and Anne-Marie Trevelyan. He also won't answer urgent questions from MPs during emergencies. It is likely, however, he will have to respond to the equivalent version in the House of Lords - a procedure put in place for Lords Mandelson and Adonis. In it not uncommon though for these questions to also be answered by deputies anyway, if the foreign secretary is on diplomatic visits around the world. As a minister in the Lords, he will have to respond to written questions from peers, as well as letters from committees. The Labour politician that Lord Cameron would normally face in the Commons, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, has said MPs won't be able him to account. Similar reservations have also been expressed by Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, who said he would do everything he could to ensure Lord Cameron faces scrutiny. This was especially important, he added, given the current series of crises around the world. He said he'd looked forward to hearing from the government how he would be held properly accountable - and had asked his parliamentary officials to draw up some ideas.",world,venezuela,0.449685534591195,636,24,26.5,60.562

Under the constant threat of bombardment in Gaza since October 7, Amal’s daily struggle to support her family has become a deadly assault course. She picks through the rubble between the school and her home in Shabura neighbourhood of Rafah in the south of Gaza, where she hopes to find neighbours with some flour to make bread. Her 24-year-old son Suleiman races to a nearby bakery first thing to grab a number in line, before hurrying to a water point. “I try to fill a canteen or two with water before getting back to the bakery before it opens,” said Suleiman. The tiring task “takes two hours, when you’re lucky, but more often four or five”, he said. There is no guarantee of success at the end, either. “We take turns in the line. Two days ago, I waited in the line for four and a half hours and when it was my turn, they told me there was no bread left. I begged them to give me just a few pieces for the children but they refused,” said his mother. Amal says the apartment block she lived in was destroyed by an Israeli bombardment on the first day of the war which followed Hamas’s attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s response has killed about 11,200 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. “Even the horse which pulled my son’s cart, his livelihood, was killed,” she said. The family spends the day in the rubble of what once was their home. Later, Amal is joined by her sister-in-law Nesrin, 39, who turns up holding up a small sack of flour like a trophy. The pair put themselves to work immediately, mixing the flour with water. One worked the dough, while the other scavenged in the rubble for pieces of cardboard and wood to make a fire to bake the flatbread. “Look at me! I’m helping, too!” said nine-year-old Bilal, laying out clothes to dry on slabs of concrete. What little water there is has to be used carefully, a little for washing clothes and some for a shower. “In general, the children and I wash every four or five days. Sometimes there is no water and we have to wait longer,” said Amal, gesturing to her bathroom, which still stood among the rubble. “It allows us to have a bit of privacy but we’re always worried a piece of concrete will fall on our heads,” she said. Her husband, Imed, tries to keep the children occupied, playing old Palestinian songs and some more modern tunes on the ney, the traditional Arab flute. “My oud was buried under the rubble but at least I have my flute to keep my spirits up and make the children smile,” he said. By the afternoon, the family had managed to secure 27 litres (seven gallons) of water, a 500-gram (18-ounce) bag of pasta and a packet of sauce – to be shared between some 50 people. “We start by feeding the children,” Imed said, as the younger members of the family lined up with their plates to get a few mouthfuls of food that quickly disappeared. After dinner, the parents poured themselves a cup of tea each. The little powdered tea they have left needs to last. With the sound of drones growing and darkness approaching, the family headed back to the UN school, where they sleep alongside thousands of others. “We do not have winter clothes for the children and each night now, it’s a little colder than the night before,” said Amal. “The children don’t sleep much and if they manage to sleep, they wake up in the night screaming,” added sister-in-law Nesrin. “So I spend the night waiting for the sunrise, so I can return close to home.”",top,united states of america,0.43252595155709345,867,35,24.771428571428572,79.972

The Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued on Tuesday a stay order against jail trial of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the cipher case, Aaj News reported. IHC halted the proceedings of the cipher case against the former prime minister before adjourning the court till November 16. A two-member bench, comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, announced the decision while hearing an intra-court appeal by PTI chief against his trial in Adiala Jail. Families of IK, Qureshi permitted to attend cypher trial During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Awan presented his arguments before the court from the government side. He informed that the government had approved the jail trial of Imran Khan and the notification would be presented to the court. Today’s proceedings were followed by the last week’s hearing, when PTI Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Salman Akram Raja requested the IHC to hold an open court trial of the cipher case. PTI assails IHC for rejecting IK’s bail plea “If the general public, media, and family members of the accused intended to witness the proceedings of the cipher case, they should be permitted,” Raja said in the previous hearing. He asserted that all people would see that no offence at all was committed in the cipher case.

At a time when African citizens are [PDF] their frustration with manipulated elections and democratic window-dressing serving as cover for corrupt and authoritarian leadership, SADC leaders bury their heads in the sand. It’s certainly not because the post-election trend line in Zimbabwe is positive, or because “quiet diplomacy” is bearing any fruit. Political violence persists in the wake of the elections. In early November, opposition member of parliament Takudzwa Ngadziore reported being abducted and violently assaulted, becoming at least the third opposition figure to report such since the August elections. Still more have been arrested on . The state also has sustained its campaign of aiding and abetting political identity theft. First, a group with little real political base was by Zimbabwe’s pliant judiciary in co-opting the name and resources of the Movement for Democratic Change, the country’s main opposition party for years, and forcing the real opposition to rebrand as the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) in 2022. Most recently, after a person claiming to be the “interim Secretary-General” of the CCC wrote to the speaker of the National Assembly claiming that fifteen newly elected opposition parliamentarians were no longer members of the party, riot police were dispatched to expel them from the chamber. The letter’s author has no legitimate claim to any leadership position in the CCC; he simply gave himself a title and to pursue the agenda of the ruling ZANU-PF, which aims to hold by-elections to fill those seats in their quest to build a majority large enough to change the constitution. The same imposter has the Minister of Local Government to remove elected mayors and city councilors who were elected under the CCC banner. The absurdity of the situation is in part intended to convey the notion that petty infighting pervades the political scene, and that Zimbabwean citizens should simply steer clear. President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his inner circle believe they can act with near-total impunity. While Southern African leaders the way Zimbabwe’s protracted crisis leads to politically explosive migration and dampens investor enthusiasm, they are unable or unwilling to confront the problem. It’s the same failure of leadership that has plunged other African regions into dangerous instability.",top,zimbabwe,0.5699797160243407,493,17,29.0,41.487

As reported by La Presse , a CRA employee responsible for auditing the MAC's finances said in an affidavit that ""The involvement of directors/employees in an apparent network of support for Hamas is troubling."" During the auditing of the organization, government employees were reportedly shocked to discover that 12 individuals who have held senior positions within the MAC are former members of Hamas-linked groups or had significant ties to them. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist entity by the Government of Canada. The audit reportedly revealed that a MAC school in Montreal once employed a man named Mohamed Zrig as an administrator. Zrig ""was denied refugee status in Canada because of his complicity in a series of crimes in Tunisia, including bombings, arson, throwing acid in the face of citizens and plotting political assassinations."" The MAC strongly denies that it has any ties to terrorism or extremism, and has called the CRA's audit ""Islamophobic."" The organization said in a statement that ""from its start, the Audit has been tainted by systemic bias and Islamophobia."" The MAC also reportedly has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization founded in Egypt that aims to implement Sharia law. A leader of the MAC was at one point a personal adviser to Mohamed Morsi, the former president of Egypt who was also a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Furthermore, the CRA uncovered concerning statements and messaging from leaders of the MAC. As reported in La Presse, ""The officials cite a speech at an assembly that talked about forcing women to offer sex on demand to their husbands or they would be damned. In another statement, it spoke of 'killing Zionists.' The IRS also noted that a MAC leader in Ontario retweeted Hamas posts 34 times on his Twitter account."" In terms of donations, the audit revealed that the MAC received $2.5M from a Qatari charity that is part of the ""Union of Good,"" an "" umbrella fundraising organization "" designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government . The U.S. government says that ""The leadership of Hamas created the Union of Good in late-2000, shortly after the start of the second Intifada, in order to facilitate the transfer of funds to Hamas."" The MAC continues to defend its actions and claim that the auditing is a result of Islamophobia and systemic biases.",top,canada,0.46041666666666664,480,17,28.235294117647058,45.455

Agencies Representative image. Chief negotiators of India and the UK are expected to soon hold next round of talks for the proposed free trade agreement to iron out differences on issues such as automobiles, medical devices, and movement of professionals, an official said. The official said that the UK team may come here for the 14th round of negotiations so that the talks can be concluded at the earliest. ""Virtual sessions are progressing. But we are planning for a full fledged round of talks. In the full round, both sides discuss all the chapters. Some 60-70 sessions happen parallelly,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said. Issues which need resolution include rules of origin; intellectual property rights (IPRs); social security agreement; duty concessions on electric vehicles, scotch whiskey, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items; liberalisation of norms in services sectors like banking and insurance. Talks are also progressing on the proposed bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The investment treaty is being negotiated as a separate agreement between India and the UK. These investment treaties help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's country. The main point of contention involved in this pact is about the mechanism for the settlement of disputes. BITs help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's countries. India has proposed to first utilise all local judicial remedies for settlement of disputes before initiating an international arbitration. India and the UK launched the talks for free-trade agreement ( FTA ) in January 2022, with an aim to conclude talks by Diwali (October 24, 2022), but the deadline was missed due to political developments in the UK. There are 26 chapters in the agreement, which include goods, services, investments and intellectual property rights. The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT, and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duties. On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, automobiles, lamb meat, chocolates and certain confectionary items. Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments like telecommunications, legal and financial services (banking and insurance). The bilateral trade between India and the UK increased to USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23 from USD 17.5 billion in 2021-22. The 'rules of origin' provision prescribes minimal processing that should happen in the FTA country so that the final manufactured product may be called originating goods in that country. Under this provision, a country that has inked an FTA with India cannot dump goods from some third country in the Indian market by just putting a label on it. It has to undertake a prescribed value addition in that product to export to India. Rules of origin norms help contain dumping of goods. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

Hash Tayeh, who founded Burgertory in 2018, has moved his family to a safe house after he exploded into the news when he was filmed leading a pro-Palestine march in Melbourne 's CBD three weeks ago. After the burger boss defended and doubled down on his stance his Caulfield restaurant was attacked by arsonists before 400 people protested down the street. Mr Tayeh had previously asked people not to join the protest and had said that he feared for the safety of his workers who had already been threatened with violence. Now he has launched a GoFundMe to help rebuild the destroyed Burgertory which has inflamed the issue again and attracted horrific comments online. Hash Tayeh (pictured) has gone into hiding after his Burgertory store in Caulfield, Melbourne, was attacked by arsonists on November 10 Mr Tayeh has since launched a GoFundMe to try and raise the funds to rebuild his store (pictured after fire) READ MORE: Hash Tayeh's open letter to the Jewish community A high-profile founder of a gourmet burger chain has been forced to publish an open letter to Melbourne's Jewish community explaining why he was filmed leading anti-Israel chants at a protest - but stopped short of apologising. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement Mr Tayeh appeared on ABC's Q&A before going into hiding where he explained to the panelists that he has become a martyr who now faces abuse daily. 'I practiced my right to protest the genocide that is happening is Gaza, the media was weaponised against me and other pro-Palestinian protestors for standing up to injustice,' he said. 'How can we protect people standing up for injustices without the threat of being cancelled or defamed?' Mr Tayeh, who has Palestinian heritage, claimed that his staff had been told that they work for a terrorist and that he had been called a pig in the streets. 'I was told that I would be made a shaheed dog, which in translation means ""you'll be made a martyr of"", so someone's threatened to kill me,' he said. Despite the abuse he has faced, Mr Tayah has continued to persistently push his pro-Palestine stance and appeared as a speaker at a rally on Saturday in Melbourne. Draped in a Palestinian flag he promised not to be silenced or intimidated by the media or people on the street. 'In the past weeks as I advocated for peace ... my own establishment became a target,' he told a crowd of thousands at the State Library. 'The other day, in a cruel act of arson, our store was reduced to ashes. To those who sought to silence us with hate and violence I say: you will not succeed.' Mr Tayeh has blamed 'zionists' for burning his store down and his GoFundMe says that the arson attack was a hate crime which left his store 'unrecognisable'. Thus far the campaign has raised more than $53,000 of it's $300,000 goal, which will go towards rebuilding the Burgertory and providing staff support payments. The burger boss has doubled down on his pro-Palestine messaging since the attack however, appearing at a protest again on Sunday where he vowed to not back down Footage surfaced on Sunday showing two hooded figures setting Caulfield's Burgertory alight at 4am on November 10 Messages on the fundraiser's page left by those who chose to donate offer a mix of resilience and sorrow for Australia's current culture wars. 'I wanted to share a message about hope. But I have none left. I am sorry dear,' one woman wrote after donating $5. 'On top of having to grieve the massive loss from the genocide, it is not fair for you to also have to grieve the loss of everything you have built for yourself and for your community,' another woman who donated $10 wrote. 'The message sent by destroying this store is to scare other prominent figures in our community into being cautious about speaking out and to punish those that do,' a third added after donating $100. Elsewhere on the internet trolls have been reveling in the destruction of Caulfield's Burgertory by posting cruel torments. One member of the Jewish community posted a video of the wrecked restaurant to X with the caption: 'Something smells burnt, I'm not sure if it's the cooking smell or the smell of burnt children in Gaza.' 'I'm sorry I am so happy that this is an arson attack because this person is a pro-Palestine,' the young man says in the clip. 'Anyone that is pro-Palestine is a Nazi and deserves to be attacked. Maybe not killed, just ruined, ruin their life.' The Jewish community has condemned the video and distanced themselves from the man who filmed it, stating that his comments were not an accurate reflection of their values.

190,09:17:34,Lorraine Kelly says witnessing horrific Lockerbie bombing was like being in a ‘warzone’,https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/14/lorraine-kelly-hits-back-revealing-lockerbie-tragedy-caused-ptsd-19808644/,"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lorraine Kelly has recalled witnessing the horror of the Lockerbie bombing, and opened up about suffering from PTSD, which she didn’t feel entitled to. Back in December 1988, Lorraine was one of the first journalists to arrive on the scene of the terror attack , in which Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the small Scottish town mid-air, killing 270 people. Before the police cordoned off the area, the presenter, now 63, saw first-hand the shocking aftermath of the disaster. She’s now returned to the scene for a new documentary, Return To Lockerbie With Lorraine Kelly, in which she admits to still struggling with what she witnessed. Appearing on Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, Lorraine recalled how the scene was like ‘a warzone’, and how surreal it was to witness. She told Susanna Reid and Ed Balls: ‘A lot of people have forgotten it was the worst terrorist atrocity in Europe.’ Lorraine went on to say that the reason she wanted to go back for the documentary stemmed from wanting to see how people have recovered from the horrific tragedy. ‘It was surreal, like a warzone,’ she recalled. ‘I remember driving down and we had to stop the car because of shrapnel,’ Lorraine went on, explaining that their car was punctured by debris, forcing them to stop. ‘Very quickly, you realise this was huge, this was enormous.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Talking about suffering from PTSD in the aftermath of her reporting, Lorraine continued: ‘Utterly surreal and horrific, and I have erased a lot of it because you can’t live with those images. ‘I was only reporting on it, I wasn’t caught up in it, I wasn’t some of the very young members of the rescue service that had to go out and retreat bodies.’ She added: ‘They were absolutely distraught.’ Lorraine said that people didn’t reach out for mental health help at the time, and while she still suffers from those horrific memories at the smell of aviation fuel , she doesn’t feel as though she’s entitled to suffering from PTSD. She said: ‘I don’t feel I was traumatised in that sense, in any way, I was only reporting on it I was just bearing witness to it, but something like that does stay with you.’ ‘I was told by an expert that I probably suffered from [PTSD], I don’t think I’m entitled to that because I was only witnessing it.’ Ahead of the documentary airing, Lorraine has spoken about how many people ‘didn’t appreciate the scale of what happened and the effect it had on people here’. In an interview, she also admitted it took her a long time to acknowledge that she was suffering from PTSD. ‘I was just doing my job. Nobody I loved was murdered – and they were murdered as far as I am concerned,’ she said of the attack, which saw Libyan Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi convicted in 2001 of planting the bomb on the plane. ‘For years, I always said, “I do not have the right to this, to have these feelings”. ‘PTSD is not me, that’s for all the people who went through losing people or were living there at the time. Or had been a soldier in a war zone,’ she added while speaking to The Telegraph . Lorraine Kelly devastated after death of ITV producer, 33 Strictly's Krishnan Guru-Murthy ordered to show off dramatic weight loss Joe Tracini still 'waiting for the old me' to turn up amid mental health battle She continued: ‘I work with Help for Heroes and so many people in the forces say, ‘I’m fine, I’m fine’, and they are not fine. But I am fine. I was only reporting on it. That’s not to say I wasn’t very badly affected.’ However, after someone made a comment online about her honest admission , Lorraine hit back. ‘Well, just think of what it did to the people were actually working on the recovery and collection of humans remains. Think about the destruction in Lockerbie. PTSD really!?,’ the X, formerly Twitter, user wrote on the social media site. Lorraine responded: ‘That’s exactly the point. I always (and still do) feel I’ve no right to have suffered any sort of trauma compared with the bereaved, the first responders and the people of Lockerbie. ‘I was only a reporter. But in the doco I learned PTSD is a normal response. I’m fine. I’m lucky,’ she added. In the documentary Lorraine speaks to Drew Young, one of a team of people asked to guard the nosecone of the plane that had fallen in a field next to Tundergarth Church, about the effect on the residents and first responders. ‘A lot of folk wouldn’t talk about it… It’s like a shutter coming down. You know, you got on with it,’ he recalled. Recalling her own traumatic memories, she said: ‘It was horrendous, eerie, really quiet, with lots of weird smells. But it is the aviation fuel that I remember most.’ Next month will mark 35 years since the then 29-year-old Lorraine arrived at the scene, which she also told the publication looked like ‘the set of a disaster movie’. ‘The exhausted rescue services searched in vain for people to save. All they could do that night, and in the days to come, was locate and recover the bodies of all of the dead,’ she shared. ‘Looking back, as we trudged through that field, I realise I was only able to function and do my job because it felt so utterly unreal. It was like the set of a disaster movie.’ While she didn’t seek counselling at the time, Lorraine said her own form of ‘therapy’ involved speaking to her father about what she saw. The presenter has said one of the main reasons she made the documentary was to highlight the issue of PTSD and encourage people suffering to get help. It has been reported that 73 per cent of people living in Lockerbie at the time of the disaster now suffer from PTSD. Return To Lockerbie With Lorraine Kelly airs at 9pm on Wednesday November 15 on ITV1. Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am on ITV1. Got a story?

191,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be? Stars of David painted on a wall in Paris on October 31. French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats. ADVERTISEMENT This incident follows a recent terrorist attack on police personnel in Tank, where three officers, including an SHO, were killed, and several others were injured. The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed numerous fatalities and injuries, primarily concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, accounting for the majority of attacks and counter-terror operations during this period. Recently, at least nine people, including five children, of the same family were killed when a rocket launcher's shell exploded at a house while the kids were playing with the ammunition in 's Sindh province, police said. Nine individuals were killed when a rocket shell they found while playing on the ground burst at home, according to Kashmore-Kandhkot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Rohil Khosa. The victims included five children, two women, and two adults from the same household, stated a report in agencies. In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital. ""This is an area on the riverine belt and the rocket shell must have been left there by dacoits who hide out deep into the riverine belt areas,"" Khoso stated. According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status.

195,11:17:45,Israeli minister supports ‘voluntary migration’ of Palestinians in Gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/israeli-minister-supports-voluntary-migration-of-palestinians-in-gaza?traffic_source=rss,"Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said “voluntary migration” of Palestinians in Gaza is the “right humanitarian solution” for the besieged enclave and for the region, a stance Palestinian officials likened to supporting “ethnic cleansing”. Smotrich’s comments come after US lawmakers Danny Danon, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, and Ram Ben-Barak, former deputy director of the intelligence agency Mossad, published a comment piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting moving some of Gaza’s population to nations that will accept them. “I welcome the initiative of members of Knesset Ram Ben-Barak and Danny Danon on the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs to the countries of the world. This is the right humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza and the entire region,” Smotrich wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday. “A cell with a small area like the Gaza Strip, without natural resources and independent sources of livelihood, has no chance to exist independently, economically and politically, in such a high density for a long time. “The reception of refugees by the countries of the world that really want their best interests, with the support and generous financial assistance of the international community, and within the state of Israel is the only solution that will bring to the end of the suffering and pain of Jews and Arabs alike.” “The State of Israel will no longer be able to put up with the existence of an independent entity in Gaza,” he added. In response to his comments, Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said in a post on X that the minister “revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government”. “ himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding an unprotected civilian population.” Smotrich revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government. Netanyahu himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding unprotected civilian population — Mustafa Barghouti @Mustafa_Barghouti (@MustafaBarghou1) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously lobbied European leaders to help him convince the Egyptian president to take in refugees from Gaza. Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence had also outlined a proposal to “evacuate” all Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt. In March, Smotrich received after saying the Palestinian people are “an invention” of the past century, with Palestinian officials blasting his comments as proof of the “racist” outlook of Israel’s far-right government. In their article on Monday, Danon and Ben-Barak said Europe had a long history of assisting refugees fleeing conflicts, and off of that example, “countries around the world should offer a haven for Gaza residents who seek relocation”. “Countries can accomplish this by creating well-structured and internationally coordinated relocation programs,” they wrote. A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. Most people in Gaza today are the children or grandchildren of those displaced during the Nakba.

196,11:22:55,Surviving a ‘republic of fraud’,https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2023-11-14/opinion/columns/Surviving-a-republic-of-fraud/1913085,"Surviving a ‘republic of fraud’ Suh Kyoung-ho The author is an editorial writer of the JoongAng Ilbo. The Jeon Cheong-jo scandal, which recently shook Korean society, has left a bad taste in the mouth. Due to the sensational recipe — a transgender con artist posing as a scion engaged to a same-sex female fencing star — the media jumped on the hot topic. But fraudulent acts are not confined to the odd couple . Fraud crimes amounted to 320,000 cases last year, adding more than 50,000 cases from five years ago. The most common case is voice phishing, fraudulent phone calls that emerged in 2006 to trick people to give away their money or private information. In 2021, money lost to voice phishing amounted to 774.4 billion won ($584 million). Korea has become a republic of fraud, with fraudsters robbing 2.1 billion won a day on average. The well-educated are equally vulnerable. Once malware gets into someone’s phone, the fraudsters can access all of the user’s calls, and the calls they receive won’t look suspicious at all. Police points to this detail as the biggest threat of the phishing crime. When victims report suspicious activities to the authorities such as the police, the prosecution, or the Financial Supervisory Service, the fraudsters will know that a report has been filed right away. The Chungnam Provincial Police Agency recently caught a voice phishing crime ring that ripped off 149.1 billion won from 1,891 people. Among the victims was a doctor who lost 4.1 billion won and a Seoul National University professor who lost 1 billion won. There were as many as 5,500 cases that were merged into the phishing crime. Kim Jong-min, director of the economic crime investigation bureau at the National Office of Investigation, called it the biggest phishing case in history. Scams have evolved in line with the advances in financial and telecommunications technologies. Scammers are riding the digital wave as smartphones and fintech become integral to everyday life. Open banking fuels the scam, as the service enables access to bank accounts — and money transfers — across financial institutions. Fraud cases involving digital assets jumped from 467.4 billion won in 2017 to 3.13 trillion won in 2021. The rise in jeonse (upfront lump-sum rent deposit) fraud last year totaled 233.5 billion won. The ratio of fraud cases among all other crimes stood at 23 percent from January to July this year. Burglaries fell below fraud from 2015. Robbing has become old-fashioned due to the increase of security cameras and fewer people hoarding hard cash. Fraud does not just cost money. They eat away the social capital of trust. Lies and false accusations are particularly common in Korea. The excess of distrust can demand a higher social cost for transaction. Since we cannot trust strangers, we rely on blood and connections and tolerate tribalism, costing the country its competitiveness. The economic repercussions from fraud are big. As frauds become globalized and advanced, it has become harder to catch the criminals. Since noncontact methods have become commonplace, identifying the criminals has become difficult. They use virtual private networks (VPNs) to escape the online chase by law enforcement authorities. Fraud arrests fell to 59 percent last year from 75 percent in 2018. When the criminals sense the police, they can easily escape overseas. More than half of the 52 percent of the criminals on the run were charged for fraud from 2020 to 2022. Seo Joon-bae, a professor at Korea National Police University, observed that “the police cannot catch con artists flying away in rockets, as police officers chase them in used cars,” adding it is important to put in place “psychological CCTVs” to control their criminality. The police are doing their best. It has been cracking down on fake bank accounts, phones, and USIM mobile phone cards. Fees for a fake bank account jumped tenfold as a result. Making the cost of committing a crime expensive can help contain the crime. The government has been running an integrated call center since September to receive complaints on voice phishing for immediate action. The crimes can be reported to the call center by dialing 112 or visiting the anti-voice phishing website, as the separate functions of the police, the Financial Supervisory Service, and the Korea Internet & Security Agency have been consolidated on those channels. Most importantly, everyone must look out for themselves. Links received in text messages should not be opened as a rule of thumb. If clicked on by accident, make sure not to tap “confirm” in the pop-up window. Money should not be sent to family members or acquaintances right after getting a call, as criminals use artificial intelligence to clone voices or faces today. The world is turning scarier by the day.",top,south korea,0.4856512141280353,906,48,18.875,65.883

As the news of the armed forces tribunal granting the relief to Captain Bhoopendra Singh reached the village in Rajouri district the men were from, their grieving families vowed not to remain silent and decided to move a higher court. Suspending the sentence, the tribunal granted conditional bail to Singh and directed him to appear before its principal registrar at regular intervals from January next year. The three men hailing from Rajouri district of Jammu region — Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammed Ibrar — were killed in the remote hilly village in Shopian district on July 18, 2020, and labelled as “terrorists”. Refusing to accept the tribunal’s decision, the families said they would take the matter to a higher court, seeking justice for their sons and hoping to unmask the truth behind the fateful encounter. “We are poor people and feel we were denied justice… We were expecting the death sentence for the captain for killing three innocents in cold blood… We will not stay silent and challenge the order of the tribunal,” Sabir Hussain, the father of Abrar Ahmed, told PTI over the phone from Rajouri. Bagha Khan, the father of Imtiyaz Ahmed, said the three victim families would fight for justice together. “We will move the higher court and appeal against the order of the tribunal. This is not acceptable to us as a compensation of Rs five lakh and a job with a salary of Rs 14,000 are not worth the lives of our children,” he added. As they prepare for the legal battle ahead, the families said they found solace in the support and solidarity garnered from their community and beyond. The village stands united, rallying behind them and demanding accountability for the lives lost and justice for the innocent souls taken too soon, the family members added. Echoing similar views, Mohammad Yousuf, the father of Ibrar, said, “It is an arduous path filled with challenges and obstacles, but my faith remains unshaken, fuelled by the memories of my son and the conviction that truth will prevail.” The three families are convinced that their fight for justice would not only bring closure to their own shattered lives but also shed light on the larger issue of human rights and the need for accountability in times of conflict. “The Court of Inquiry proved that they were innocents who had gone there (Shopian) for work. During the court-martial, I visited Kashmir hundreds of times and used to stay for days together in Srinagar to ensure justice is done,” Yousuf said. “When the Court of Inquiry awarded a life sentence to the captain, we felt happy that justice was done to us,” he said. However, the latest court verdict has reopened old wounds. Yousuf said. “We feel disappointed and do not know where we should make an appeal for justice. I have lost a desire to live and now my Allah will provide me justice.” In a 25-page order on November 9, the two-member tribunal headed by chairperson Justice Rajendra Menon said, “…in our considered view, the evidence relied upon by the prosecution and accepted by the SGCM (Summary General Court Martial) in the present case is not convincing enough to hold the applicant guilty of the charges levelled against him. Prima facie, based on the material available on record we are convinced that likelihood of the applicant being acquitted after hearing of this appeal cannot be ruled out.” “The applicant has already been in custody for a period of about three years and therefore, it is a fit case where, prima facie, evidence available on record suggests that bail can be granted to the applicant by suspending the sentence,” the tribunal stated. The conditions put forth for the bail include that he shall not approach anyone who had testified against him and that he shall surrender his passport to the principal registrar and in case he does not possess a passport, he shall file an affidavit to that effect besides he shall not leave the country without leave of the tribunal. Following the allegations against the Army, the Jammu and Kashmir Police had also constituted a special investigation team which filed a charge sheet against three people, including Captain Singh, for “staging a fake encounter”. Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha visited the families of the slain men in Rajouri in 2020 and conveyed to them Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message that the government stood with the aggrieved families and that they would be taken care of with all support from the government. The identity of the three men was subsequently confirmed through a DNA test. The bodies were handed over to their families in Baramulla in October 2020 and buried in their native village in Rajouri. On September 5, the Jammu and Kashmir administration handed over appointment letters for government jobs to family members of the deceased men.",top,india,0.41804979253112035,964,31,31.096774193548388,55.245
198,08:00:07,"Readers sound off on keeping dogs outside, protesting Israel and the Trump children’s testimony",https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/11/14/readers-sound-off-on-keeping-dogs-outside-protesting-israel-and-the-trump-childrens-testimony/,"Brooklyn: Last week, the “Mutts” comic strip featured a well-known character named Guard Dog who is chained outdoors, depressed and dreams about running free. By Friday, I broke down and am still crying as I write this. Years ago, our family lived in a small upstate town next to a neighbor who owned a collie. It was routine for the winters there to dip below zero degrees overnight and stay in the single digits during the day. The collie, Laddie, was tied outside beside a meager doghouse that did little to nothing to keep him warm. We used to see Laddie shivering in the snow with icicles clinging to his coat. My mom was indignant and spoke a few words to the man who owned Laddie: “It’s too cold, you should take Laddie inside the house.” The man, a corrections officer, replied: “I have to stand outside all day in the freezing cold. If it’s good enough for me, it’s good enough for my dog.” Guard Dog has been instrumental in encouraging state laws restricting tethering nationwide. Other states have them. Astonishingly, New York has had Bill A5854A shuttling back and forth for years in the Assembly, being amended and returned, re-amended and re-returned and so forth. It’s currently in committee. This bill would restrict how long a dog can be tied without shelter, protect sick and injured animals, assure proper shelter including room to move around and fine anyone in violation. It’s a shame that such laws are necessary. It’s a greater shame that the wheels of justice have evidently frozen like Laddie, with icicles hanging from their spokes. Brooklyn: For the past several weeks, my Sunday paper has been delivered without the comics section, leaving my inner child deeply disappointed. Ever since I was a little kid, reading the Sunday funnies has been a ritual (although now that I’m grown, I do read the actual newspaper afterward). Yes, I’m aware that I can read them online as part of my subscription, but some of us readers are loyal to the print edition and relish the experience of reading the physical paper — and The News should be supporting the folks who support its print edition and who do not want to see the demise of print publishing. Toward that end, please enlarge the Saturday back-page crossword! I end up with such a headache. Morristown, N.J.: Most people would not consider John Rote to be a “vigilante,” as . He is actually a hero, unless you’re a bleeding-heart, gutless liberal. Glad to hear that the victim is fine, but she took the low road in knocking the very person who came to her aid. If there is a next time, there may be no one there to help. Then she’d be praying for a John Rote to appear. Coward Matthew Roesch, spineless enough to harass this woman, should have caught a bullet in the derrière. It might make him think twice about being a lowlife thug. Providence, R.I.: Re “ ” (Nov. 12), which says that Benjamin Netanyahu “insisted that after the war, now entering its sixth week, Gaza would be demilitarized and Israel would retain security control there”: Retaining Israel’s harsh control / for Gaza, means a mortal toll / but Bibi vows to stay the course / and neither side displays remorse. West Hempstead, L.I.: To Voicer Richie Nagan: Of course they did. There is no difference between Hamas and Fatah. Both support “from the river to the sea.” Both support death to Jews. Both say no Jews can live there at all. Both pay terrorists to kill Jews. So Israel wanted to weaken Fatah, not replace it. In 1979, the U.S. supported the return of the ayatollah to Iran. In the 1980s, we supported the mujahedeen against Russia and look where we are now. Not all decisions are wise or work out as planned. It does not excuse Hamas’ barbarity, nor does it lessen the justice and validity of Israel’s quest to destroy Hamas. Penticton, British Columbia: Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas has unleashed Operation Overkill — a genocidal war on thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians, particularly children. The inhumane suffering and complete destruction of Gaza by incessant Israeli bombing will go down in infamy alongside the Jewish Holocaust as the Palestinian Genocide. The Gaza demolition is creating worldwide protests that risk becoming violent, resulting in social unrest, destabilizing nations. Combined with Putin’s Ukraine invasion, climate change and ensuing hunger, this makes world peace a daunting challenge. Bronx: Your apologist editorial on the role of the teachers union and other official organizations in organizing student walkouts in support of Palestine (“ ,” Nov. 11) did hit one solid note: the need to teach. Do we teach our children about the American hostages held in Iran for 444 days? Who Leon Klinghoffer was and why he was murdered? Are the 220 Marines murdered in Beirut ever discussed, or the 9/11 attacks on our nation? Do we explain to our children that these events were all linked by being carried out by Islamic extremists? That the same ideology was behind the Oct. 7 massacre of Jews in Israel, one that included dozens of our fellow Americans? Probably not, because either the teachers were not taught these things or they have embraced the woke ideologies that defame democracy, disdain civil discourse and denounce freedom in the name of universal victimhood. Brooklyn: There seems to be a widespread pattern of people being denied job opportunities or being terminated from their employment because they showed just an ounce of sympathy for the Palestinian people and were highly critical of the Israeli government. How many people have been denied job opportunities or were terminated for denouncing Hamas and the Palestinian Authority and showing an enormous amount of support for the state of Israel? Just asking. Bellerose Village, L.I.: Anyone ever wonder what’s going to happen when artificial intelligence takes control of a self-driving car and drives it into an innocent crowd of people? Brooklyn: It is clear that the current Republicans are the real enemies of the American people. They refuse to accept any election returns that go against them, whether it is their refusal to accept the reality that President Biden won the 2020 election or trying to force abortion restrictions on their voters. They lose every challenge, yet they are still trying to overturn the will of the people. They are also trying to defund the government and deny government workers their salaries. The Republicans are acting more like spoiled children than responsible legislators. Kew Gardens: Interestingly, all three of Donald Trump’s children testified that they had no knowledge, skills or job responsibilities related to the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial reports. Their testimonies leave two people responsible: their father or the accountant. There is always a fall guy or buffer between Trump and punishment, which is a typical pattern for those who do business with this man. His concern is for himself only, a trait that the American people should be wary of. Old Bridge, N.J.: If Fred Trump hadn’t had money, Orangino would still be in grammar school. Staten Island: After their last month’s 16-31 loss to the Miami Dolphins, the New York Giants should have their name changed to the “N.Y. Lilliputians” — ouch! How’s that for “pun-ishment”? Jamaica: To Voicer John Pasquali: I totally agree with your assessment of the state of the Yankees management, and I’m totally glad to see another person recognize the Jordan Montgomery blunder. I can see a great Bill Gallo sketch for this Yankee season: Hero and GOAT. World Series champion: Jordan Montgomery.

Israel army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli army confirmed the death of Noa Marciano, a woman soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas. ""Exciting news!

""Is killing more Palestinians, is killing more than 11,000 Palestinians going to produce the peace and security that we all want for both Palestinians and Israelis? Or is it going to push the region further into hatred and despair and hopelessness?"" Mr Safadi said on 7.30. The deputy prime minister spoke to just days after Jordan joined a summit of Arab leaders urging fan immediate ceasefire in the Middle East. ""One of the outcomes of the Arab League and Muslim summit was to entrust the Secretariat of both organisations to start preparing files to document Israeli war crimes with a view to take legal action in international courts."" ""Pushing 67 per cent of Gaza's population to 56 per cent of the area of Gaza, to an area that doesn't have basic necessities, doesn't have enough hospitals, clinics or water."" ""That means concentrating 2.3 million people in an area that cannot sustain them, which would mean more misery … more hopelessness. And that is not going to be an environment in which calls for peace will thrive. I think this is another war crime."" Hospitals in Gaza have become a flashpoint in the fighting, with the Israeli Defence Force claiming Hamas uses health facilities to hide its military operations. Yesterday it released footage it claimed was filmed in Gaza's now deserted Rantisi hospital showing weapons, a tunnel entrance and a hideout used to hold hostages. The ABC has not been able to verify the footage. Mr Safadi said the claim needed to be verified by ""an independent entity"". ""It's going to be extremely hard for anybody in this part of the world to believe the claims of an army that has brought hell on 2.3 million people,"" he said. Mr Safadi said the conflict will lead to a perpetuation of violence in the region. ""This war is not just killing innocent Palestinians and destroying their livelihoods. It's creating an environment of hate."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza after the war for Israel's security. Last week on 7.30 Netanyahu adviser Mark Regev said elements of that military presence could be similar to the West Bank. Jordan's deputy prime minister rejected the idea. As Israeli forces press deeper into Gaza on their mission to destroy Hamas, the enclave's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a focal point. ""What we've been seeing very clearly is that approaching this conflict from a pure security zone, as if the assumption is that you can just suffocate people's aspirations for freedom, and then we can move ahead with that, that doesn't work,"" he said before calling for a permanent, two-state solution. ""What we all in the Arab world are saying is that there needs to be a comprehensive, immediate move to settle this conflict once and for all … address the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, and address Israel's right to security."" He also warned that the current war could expand rapidly due to tensions in the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. ""The West Bank is boiling as a result of Israeli operational measures there … you have other fronts, particularly the Lebanese-Israeli border, we're seeing tension rising there. I think unless this war stops, we're looking at the very real threat of this war expanding and dragging this whole region into the abyss of this ugly conflict."" Do you know more about this story?

201,11:43:38,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

(AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by Jewish peace activists calling for a cease fire in Gaza staged a sit-in inside of the federal building in Oakland, California, leading to multiple arrests. People wore T-shirts reading ""Jews Say Cease-fire Now” and carried banners that read “Not in Our Name” and “Let Gaza Live” in the rotunda of the Rondald V. Dellums Federal building on Monday evening. Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the protest organizers, posted online that dozens of people had been taken into custody by 9 p.m. Protesters were escorted outside of the building by U.S. Department of Homeland Security police. Messages were sent early Tuesday to the department and to Oakland police asking how many people were arrested and on what charges. “There is no other choice,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of Berkeley told KNTV-TV when explaining why she was at the sit-in. “How many people do we have to kill before we arrive at a cease fire?” The protest was part of a growing number across the country following fighting triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel , whose response has led to thousands of deaths — and much destruction — across Gaza. On Monday, hundreds of Jewish peace activists and their allies converged at a major train station in downtown Chicago during rush hour blocking the entrance to the Israeli consulate and demanding U.S. support for an Israel cease-fire. Jewish Voice for Peace led a similar sit-in in New York City’s Grand Central Station on Oct. 27, where a sea of protesters filled the main concourse during evening rush hour, chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. At least 200 demonstrators were detained by New York police officers. The Associated Press",top,canada,0.5787965616045845,349,15,23.266666666666666,57.561
204,13:20:21,Silver catalysts spark a revolution in affordable fuel cells,https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/silver-catalysts-affordable-fuel-cells,"In a bid to unlock the full potential of hydrogen fuel cells as a cleaner alternative to conventional energy sources, researchers from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, and the Toyota Research Institute (TRI) have made significant strides in reducing the cost of . The breakthrough involves a radical shift in the catalyst composition, traditionally reliant on expensive platinum group metals (PGM), according to an . Catalyst revolution: Silver takes the lead Hydrogen fuel cells have long been recognized for their promise in energy storage and conversion, but the prohibitive cost of PGMs in the catalyst has hindered widespread adoption. , associate scientist with SLAC and Stanford University, explained, “Hydrogen fuel cells have really great potential for energy storage and conversion, using hydrogen as an alternative fuel to, say, gasoline. But it's still fairly expensive to run a fuel cell.” The team's innovative approach involves replacing some costly PGMs with a more economical alternative: silver. However, the real breakthrough lies in simplifying the chemical process of applying the catalyst to the cell's electrodes. The conventional method of mixing the catalyst into a liquid and spreading it onto the mesh electrode proved inconsistent in real-world applications. , director of SUNCAT, commented, “Wet chemical processes are not particularly resilient concerning laboratory conditions.” Vacuum power: Precision in catalyst deposition To overcome the reproducibility challenges, the researchers employed a vacuum chamber for controlled depositions of the new catalyst onto electrodes. This method ensures a more reliable translation from lab experiments to practical fuel cells. Jaramillo emphasized the benefits of this approach, stating, “This high-vacuum tool is a very ‘what you see is what you get’ type of method. As long as your system is calibrated well, in principle, people can reproduce it readily.” Collaborating with experts at Technion Israel Institute of Technology, the researchers successfully demonstrated the practical application of their method in a fuel cell. , the lead Stanford graduate student on the project, forged a crucial connection with Dario Dekel and his PhD student John Douglin at Technion, facilitating fuel cell testing. Affordable excellence: Silver catalysts shine The collaborative effort proved that substituting silver for some of the PGMs in previous catalysts could achieve an equally effective fuel cell at a significantly lower cost. This opens up possibilities for more ambitious ideas, with the potential of eliminating PGMs from the catalyst composition. Tom Jaramillo expressed optimism about the future possibilities, stating, “We could try going entirely PGM-free.” , a chemical engineering professor and director of the Grand Technion Energy Program at Technion, echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the wide-reaching implications for academic research and practical catalyst development in the fuel cell industry. Looking ahead, Jaramillo emphasized the pivotal role that cost reduction plays in determining the success of fuel cells in heavy-duty transportation and . He concluded, “Fuel cells are really looking exciting and interesting, but it’s ultimately going to come down to lowering cost, which is what this collaborative work is all about.” This groundbreaking research, funded in part by the DOE's Office of Science through the , a SLAC-Stanford joint institute, and the , represents a significant step toward making fuel cells a more economically viable and sustainable energy solution.",top,united states of america,0.48314606741573035,623,21,29.666666666666668,30.11

Victoria continued her heartfelt message by saying: ""A lot of the time that thing we call love can more accurately be described as attachment or desire or need or longing or closeness or connection. And all of these are totally valuable and human and we need to acknowledge and appreciate and accept every part of our experience."" ""But sometimes when you love very deeply you will find yourself facing terrifying fears of loss that can feel so big and devastating that you don't know how you can survive them and you can't imagine life without this person that you love. It's in these moments when you are staring into the abyss that you have an opportunity to expand your consciousness beyond the limitations of your mind. ""You have an opportunity to discover more of who you really are and more of who your soul really is and more of your connection with this person who you love,"" she wrote. ""You might alternate between terror and a sense of peace or a feeling of appreciation for what you have in the moment together or grace or gratitude for the love and support that is offered to help you by other people."" ""Fear is an unknown place and this is what makes it so frightening, we makeup stories about what is beyond the fear and they are not happy stories. But we can choose to stay present with everything that unfolds and to feel as much as possible in every moment and we can be surprised that there are more moments of beauty and grace and even joy than we ever imagined."" ""Stay tuned in to love no matter what is happening in your world and keep inviting all of your angels and guides to support you and know that love is always the best choice! #angels #love #ascension,"" Victoria concluded.",top,united kingdom,0.4751131221719457,442,13,34.0,60.534

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel and around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli officials. In Gaza, more than 11,200 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed. At least 179 people, including babies and patients who died in the intensive care unit, were buried in a ""mass grave"" at Gaza's biggest hospital. Seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those buried after hospital fuel supplies ran out at the compound. Israel accused Hamas of using hospitals as hideouts. Hamas has denied the claim. US president Joe Biden urged Israel to protect Gaza's main hospital saying, “It's my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital. The hospital must be protected.” Israel's army cited a discarded baby bottle, makeshift toilet and motorbike as evidence that Hamas held hostages in a Gaza hospital. Israel army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli army confirmed the death of Noa Marciano, a woman soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas. ""Exciting news!

""Is killing more Palestinians, is killing more than 11,000 Palestinians going to produce the peace and security that we all want for both Palestinians and Israelis? Or is it going to push the region further into hatred and despair and hopelessness?"" Mr Safadi said on 7.30. The deputy prime minister spoke to just days after Jordan joined a summit of Arab leaders urging fan immediate ceasefire in the Middle East. ""One of the outcomes of the Arab League and Muslim summit was to entrust the Secretariat of both organisations to start preparing files to document Israeli war crimes with a view to take legal action in international courts."" ""Pushing 67 per cent of Gaza's population to 56 per cent of the area of Gaza, to an area that doesn't have basic necessities, doesn't have enough hospitals, clinics or water."" ""That means concentrating 2.3 million people in an area that cannot sustain them, which would mean more misery … more hopelessness. And that is not going to be an environment in which calls for peace will thrive. I think this is another war crime."" Hospitals in Gaza have become a flashpoint in the fighting, with the Israeli Defence Force claiming Hamas uses health facilities to hide its military operations. Yesterday it released footage it claimed was filmed in Gaza's now deserted Rantisi hospital showing weapons, a tunnel entrance and a hideout used to hold hostages. The ABC has not been able to verify the footage. Mr Safadi said the claim needed to be verified by ""an independent entity"". ""It's going to be extremely hard for anybody in this part of the world to believe the claims of an army that has brought hell on 2.3 million people,"" he said. Mr Safadi said the conflict will lead to a perpetuation of violence in the region. ""This war is not just killing innocent Palestinians and destroying their livelihoods. It's creating an environment of hate."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel will maintain a military presence in Gaza after the war for Israel's security. Last week on 7.30 Netanyahu adviser Mark Regev said elements of that military presence could be similar to the West Bank. Jordan's deputy prime minister rejected the idea. As Israeli forces press deeper into Gaza on their mission to destroy Hamas, the enclave's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has become a focal point. ""What we've been seeing very clearly is that approaching this conflict from a pure security zone, as if the assumption is that you can just suffocate people's aspirations for freedom, and then we can move ahead with that, that doesn't work,"" he said before calling for a permanent, two-state solution. ""What we all in the Arab world are saying is that there needs to be a comprehensive, immediate move to settle this conflict once and for all … address the rights of the Palestinians to freedom and statehood, and address Israel's right to security."" He also warned that the current war could expand rapidly due to tensions in the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. ""The West Bank is boiling as a result of Israeli operational measures there … you have other fronts, particularly the Lebanese-Israeli border, we're seeing tension rising there. I think unless this war stops, we're looking at the very real threat of this war expanding and dragging this whole region into the abyss of this ugly conflict."" Do you know more about this story?

210,13:04:46,"In fight to curb climate change, a grim report shows world is struggling to get on track",https://www.nsnews.com/environment-news/in-fight-to-curb-climate-change-a-grim-report-shows-world-is-struggling-to-get-on-track-7827248,"The world is off track in its efforts to curb global warming in 41 of 42 important measurements and is even heading in the wrong direction in six crucial ways, a new international report calculates. The only bright spot is that global sales of electric passenger vehicles are now on track to match what’s needed — along with many other changes — to limit future warming to just another couple tenths of a degree, according to the State of Climate Action report released Tuesday by the World Resources Institute, Climate Action Tracker, the Bezos Earth Fund and others. On the flip side, public money spent to create more fossil fuel use is going in the wrong direction and faster than it has in the past, said study co-author Kelly Levin, science and data director at the Bezos Earth Fund. “This is not the time for tinkering around the edges, but it’s instead the time for radical decarbonization of all sectors of the economy,” Levin said. “We are woefully off track and we are seeing the impact of inaction unfold around the world from extensive wildfire fires in Canada , heat-related deaths across the Mediterranean , record high temperatures in South Asia and so on,"" she said. Later this month, crucial international climate negotiations start in Dubai that include the first time world negotiators will do a global stocktake on how close society is to meeting its 2015 climate goals. In advance of the United Nations summit, numerous reports from experts are coming out assessing Earth’s progress or mostly the lack of it, including a United States national assessment with hundreds of indicators. Tuesday’s 42 indicators offers one of the grimmest report cards, detailing multiple failures of society. The report looks at what’s needed in several sectors of the global economy — power, transportation, buildings, industry, finance and forestry — to fit in a world that limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times, the goal the world adopted at Paris in 2015. The globe has already warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century. Six categories — the carbon intensity of global steel production, how many miles passenger cars drive, electric buses sold, loss of mangrove forests, amount of food waste and public financing of fossil fuel use — are going in the wrong direction, the report said. “Fossil fuel consumption subsidies in particular reached an all-time high last year, over $1 trillion, driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy price spikes,” said report co-author Joe Thwaites of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. Another six categories were considered “off track” but going in the right direction, which is the closest to being on track and better than the 24 measurements that are “well off track.” Those merely off track include zero-carbon electricity generation, electric vehicles as percentage of the fleet, two- and three-wheel electric vehicle sales, grazing animal meat production, reforestation and share of greenhouse gas emissions with mandatory corporate climate risk reporting requirements. People should be worried that this report is one of ’’too little, too late,” said University of Arizona climate scientist Katharine Jacobs, who wasn’t part of the report but praised it for being so comprehensive. “I am not shocked that at a global scale we are not meeting expectations for reducing emissions,” Jacobs said in an email. “We cannot ignore the fact that global commitments to (greenhouse gas) reductions are essentially unenforceable and that a number of major setbacks have taken a toll on our progress.” When trying to change an economy, the key is to start with “low-hanging fruit, i.e., the sectors of the economy that are easiest to transition and give a big bang for your buck,” said Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin, who isn’t part of the report.

211,17:30:16,Marianne Williamson: 'My campaign is the most serious campaign',https://www.dailykos.com/story/2023/11/12/2205336/-Marianne-Williamson-My-campaign-is-the-most-serious-campaign?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=,"Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming for months across America — to audiences large and small, from churches and colleges to spiritual centers and soup kitchens — in a demanding schedule of appearances in her second tenacious, against-the-odds run for the presidency. The bestselling spiritual author and one-time advisor to Oprah Winfrey didn't make it to the 2020 primaries in a wide-open Democratic field. Now she is running against a sitting president from her own party, and the Democratic establishment has closed ranks behind Joe Biden. Even some of her most devoted followers doubt she can be elected. So why is Williamson even running? She says it's the faith she has in herself and the American people. ""The most important things you do in life, not because there's guaranteed success on some external level, but because you feel in your heart it's the right thing to do,"" Williamson, 71, said during an interview in New York City. She admits it has been grueling at times — not just the punishing campaign schedule, but more so the emotional bruising from a barrage of unflattering characterizations. For her, it's ""the ultimate challenge to have tough skin, but a soft and open heart,"" she said. But Williamson worries that negative perceptions detract from her policy positions, which include financial reparations for Black Americans and creation of a Department of Peace. ""What are the words they use? Wacky, kooky, crystal lady,"" she said, listing the names she's called. ""People will take one line out of a book, completely out of context. That has certainly been done to me. Plus, you know, they lie."" Born in Houston to a Jewish family, Judaism remains her core belief, and she also embraces universal spiritual themes, like loving one another. Williamson came into the spotlight with her popular 1992 book, ""A Return to Love."" Oprah, highlighting it on her own site, wrote: ""I have never been more moved by a book."" Williamson, the author of more than a dozen titles and well-known for supporting LGBTQ people, retains a legion of dedicated fans. Millions buy her books, attend her lectures and engage with her on TikTok. ""She is extremely sincere in her beliefs, wise in many ways even,"" said Issac Bailey, a communications professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who has written about Williamson's faith and politics. ""But she also has a streak that takes her beyond the pale."" He pointed to her wariness and sharp criticism of government vaccine mandates that came up during her last campaign. She later said she supports vaccines. ""I'm a socially middle of the road Jew who goes to the doctor,"" she said. ""I'm not a crystal lady. I understand how important science is."" Williamson entered politics with an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014, then broke onto the national stage two years later as a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders' failed presidential bid. In 2020, she entered the race herself. She acknowledges making what she calls ""cringeworthy"" comments back then, like how she would harness love to defeat former President Donald Trump. ""Once they could be contextualized in a way that made me appear silly, there was almost no getting past the mockery,"" she said. People may embrace quasi-spiritual language in their private lives, but if it's from political candidates, it typically doesn't play well on the campaign trail, said Galen Watts, a sociology and legal studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But this is not new territory for Williamson. For years, she has been under fire from intellectuals who call her theology too shallow, from politicians who mock her ideas, and more recently from some former campaign staff who say she's irascible and is only trying to sell more books. She concedes that she probably swore more than she should have in her last campaign, but scoffs at the book-selling gibe. ""The way to sell books is by going on a book tour, not a presidential campaign,"" she said. ""The way to sell books in my field is to never mention politics."" Some have questioned her political inexperience. But she dismisses that: ""I reject the notion that only those whose careers have been ensconced in the car that drove us into this ditch are the only people we should consider qualified to drive us out of the ditch."" She announced her candidacy in February, and now is arguably the best-known Democrat still challenging Biden for the party's 2024 presidential nomination. But recent polls show her running more than 60 percentage points behind. She is well-liked by many young people, including Jose Serna, a 21-year-old at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Serna hopes she stays in the race ""because she is illuminating the ideas that young people care about"" including Medicare for all, equitable wages and affordable housing. ""While I do believe that it is unlikely that Marianne will win the nomination, it is not because of her policies,"" he said, citing a common complaint by Williamson and her backers about a lack of media attention. Marie Griffith, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, says there's a practical reason why Williamson stands no chance of winning. ""She has no connection that I know of to Democratic machine politics — meaning the people who raise all the money and make or break the political careers of those identifying as Democrats,"" Griffith said. Williamson talks at times in religious and spiritual terms to describe America as a nation in need of confession and atonement. She worries about vast economic inequality and wants to declare a climate emergency. One of her signature policy proposals would have the government pay Black citizens reparations for centuries of enslavement and discrimination. She advocated for this in her 1997 book ""The Healing of America."" Today, she proposes creating a council of Black academic, cultural and political leaders to disperse at least $1 trillion to Black Americans over two decades. Author and rabbi Jay Michaelson lauded Williamson for raising the issue before other political candidates, and for her work during the AIDS crisis, but in 2019 he wrote a scathing critique of her bid for president. He called her ""selfish, deluded and dumb by denigrating science"" and said she gives spiritually a bad name. Michaelson, in a recent interview, said he agreed with Williamson ""that our spiritual commitments and our religious commitments should impact our political lives."" But he says she will remain a fringe candidate because some of her policy positions are too radical for many. ""To say, 'We need a politics of love' without explaining what that is,"" he said. ""Or that we need a new paradigm, or that we need some kind of revolution — that doesn't play on Main Street."" Williamson denies denigrating science and disputes broader criticisms of her campaign. ""This idea that I am unserious — my campaign is the one talking about one in four Americans living with medical debt. My campaign is the one talking about the fact that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,"" she said. ""My campaign is the most serious campaign.""",top,united states of america,0.4093484419263456,1412,61,23.147540983606557,60.728

""This is what I use to treat a player who keeps getting injured in big games,"" said Sheikh Issa, whose name we have changed at his request. He was really low and ""I had to clean his star"", said the Ivory Coast-born ""traditional practitioner"", who claims to be able to ""see both the past and the future"". With so much money at stake, and careers that can end on a single tackle, elite sports people ""regularly turn to witch doctors and to the paranormal"", said Joel Thibault, an evangelical pastor who is a spiritual advisor to French striker Olivier Giroud and other top athletes. All this had been discreetly going out of the public eye until Pogba -- whose parents come from Guinea -- fell victim to an alleged extortion attempt by some of his entourage last year. His brother later claimed Pogba paid a witch doctor to hex Mbappe, but both the former Manchester United star and the healer told police they did nothing of the kind. The marabout said the substantial payments Pogba made to him were for ""good works in Africa"". With three out of 10 people in France prone to believe in some sort of sorcery, according to a 2020 survey, AFP has been investigating this closed world for the past year. We discovered how faith healers are ""half feared and half despised"" -- as one anthropologist put it -- and why they hold such sway in some communities. Sheikh Issa wears jeans in the street, but when he welcomes his clients into his surgery he sports a long African boubou robe. ""I don't believe in gris-gris or amulets, I believe in the Koran and in plants,"" said the 45-year-old, who also runs a cleaning business. The tools of his trade are arranged around him in a couple of dozen bottles and plastic bags -- tree bark that protects you from the ""evil eye"", ground seeds that ""keep you lucky"", and potions to ""add sheen"" and charisma to ""politicians, lawyers and business people"" who Sheikh Issa said come to him looking to ""be loved and admired"". And, of course, remedies to enhance ""sexual power"", he said pointing to another bottle. France is a ""stressful country and some people are weak in bed"", added the sheikh, a little sheepishly. Afterwards they call and say, ""Thank you, Sheikh."" Sheikh Issa got ""the gift"" from his mother ""who read shells"" and his father, who is an imam. He trained with faith healers in West Africa -- where people often consult marabouts -- after studying at a koranic school. He said his reputation took off when he ""helped"" a politician become a government minister. His three phones buzz constantly with messages. Most of the sheikh's clients -- who he insists only pay the cost of importing his plants and his travel expenses -- are mostly African and South Asian, although some come from both the French Caribbean and France itself. One summer's day when AFP visited his consulting room, a young Comorian woman ""who lives with spirits and self harms"" was waiting to see him along with ""a Moroccan desperate"" about his failing bakery. ""People don't talk when they come for the first time,"" he said. ""I have to guess"" what is wrong. Some are having trouble at home or at work, have health problems or are looking for ""the love of their life"", he said. The mostly West African witch doctors operating in France -- who see themselves as healers of the soul -- have learned to adapt to malheurs of their French clients. Many go to them as others would go to a psychologist or a clarevoyant, experts say. Anthropologist Liliane Kuczynski, author of the definitive book, ""African marabouts in Paris"", found clients come from a wide social spectrum, from undocumented migrants to graduates and teachers. ""Far from being obscure and marginal, belief in superstitions and the paranormal has become a constantly rising majority phenomenon,"" French polling company Ifop found in 2020. ""Marabouts are particularly gifted with emotional intelligence,"" anthropologist Marie Miran-Guyon of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris told AFP. ""And for some it works. Placebo effect or not, from the moment people believe it can make a difference,"" it can, she added. But Monsieur Fakoly, a Guinean healer working in Paris, who comes from a line of marabouts, had his own view of how it works. ""Every one of us has a star. If it is dirty, people fail and have bad luck. So you have to purify the soul,"" he said. ""Prayers and advice will help the person feel better. We listen, we give medicine, but not the kind you get in a pharmacy!"" said the healer, one of eight interviewed by AFP. Raymond, 61, had just arrived in Sheikh Issa's consulting room. The sheikh slowly shook his hand, pressing his thumb to ""test the energy... I feel it's angry, that things are not good."" Then Raymond picked up a pen and brought it to his lips without saying a word. In the silence, the sheikh wrote in his notebook, then traced some lines between the letters to evoke the ""16 spirits"" using a technique called geomancy. ""My ears are hot, I feel a bar in the middle of my forehead,"" he told his client. ""The spirits are working on me."" Raymond -- who asked that we not use his real name -- was convinced his ex-wife had ""cast a spell on him"" after they divorced a decade ago. He was tired and in pain and ""I went to work like a zombie"". Rather than go to a doctor he sought succour at a prophetic African church, but to no avail. So he began to consult healers who read shells. ""All they did was take my money,"" he said. A fellow construction worker recommended Sheikh Issa. ""It was if he had lived alongside me all those years,"" Raymond recalled. ""He recounted my life from A to Z. I couldn't believe it."" The sheikh prepared him potions in West African jars called canaris. ""Take the canari home wash yourself with the potion,"" Raymond remembered him telling him. From that day on ""I got my health back"", said Raymond. ""Some (marabouts) are like psychotherapists... while others are swindlers,"" said anthropologist Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). Some come from a Sufi tradition with a deep ""religious culture and desire to help"", he said, but others know little more than ""a few surahs of the Koran and extract the maximum for their victims,"" he added. Anyone who says they have the gift and some knowledge of Islam, divination and miracle working can call themselves a marabout. Some charge no more than a dozen euros for an appointment, though the price can go up to several hundred or thousands for a sacrifice, even tens of thousands in some cases. Therapist Assa Djelou regularly receives clients who have been let down by marabouts. She said some have a ""dangerous"" hold on people. Rather than ""facing up to reality"", the healers convince people their problems ""have been caused by spells cast on them, which can lead to anxiety and depression"". The French police only get involved when there are complaints about fraud or practising medicine illegally. But such cases are rare and there's a ""taboo"" about talking about it, said Djelou. In sport, where superstition is commonplace, things can also quickly get out of hand. ""Careers are short and the least injury"" can be catastrophic, said Thibault, the pastor who has supported several top athletes. Sometimes they need help because they ""do not have the inner strength to get over everything"" thrown at them. But ""what these marabouts do is very dangerous"", he claimed. Former footballer Cisse Baratte told AFP how he fell under the influence of witch doctors as a rising young player plucked from the Ivory Coast to play in France. Soon he had become ""dependent"" on the amulets, ""protection belts"" and sacrifices they made for him. The legendary French football manager Claude Le Roy, who managed six African national teams, knows the problem well. He was even threatened and branded the ""white sorcerer"" for driving marabouts away from his staff and players. ""Some players have a need to talk with their marabouts, it can comfort them, and it is also a link with their homeland,"" he added. Even though he insists that ""he doesn't believe in the slightest"" in their powers, Le Roy is still troubled by one incident. In 1997, after a catastrophic away leg in the Champions League against Steaua Bucarest which they lost 3-0, Paris Saint-Germain had to win by four goals to go through. Desperate for anything that might help, the club paid ""a grand Malian marabout"" 500 euros. ""He asked us for photos of the players and their numbers, and just before the home leg told us that number 18 would score the fourth goal in the 37th minute."" PSG won 5-0, with its number 18 scoring the fourth goal in the 41st minute...

215,10:03:46,Pakistan: 2 soldiers killed in gun battle with terrorists in north Waziristan,https://www.mid-day.com/news/world-news/article/pakistan-2-soldiers-killed-in-gun-battle-with-terrorists-in-north-waziristan-23319820,"Two soldiers lost their lives in an armed confrontation between security forces and terrorists in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan district in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The clash resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and one terrorist, as reported by Pakistan-based Dawn, citing the military's media affairs wing. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that troops engaged effectively with the terrorists' location, resulting in the elimination of one terrorist. The fallen soldiers were identified as Sepoy Abdullah (25) and Sepoy Muhammad Sohail (19). Efforts are underway to clear the surrounding areas and neutralize any remaining threats. ADVERTISEMENT This incident follows a recent terrorist attack on police personnel in Tank, where three officers, including an SHO, were killed, and several others were injured. The police were targeted while attempting to apprehend kidnappers. The escalating violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan has seen a surge in terror-related activities since the termination of the ceasefire between the Pakistan government and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan last year. Statistics reveal a distressing trend, with a significant increase in casualties among security personnel, reaching an eight-year high. The third quarter of 2023 witnessed numerous fatalities and injuries, primarily concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, accounting for the majority of attacks and counter-terror operations during this period. Recently, at least nine people, including five children, of the same family were killed when a rocket launcher's shell exploded at a house while the kids were playing with the ammunition in 's Sindh province, police said. Nine individuals were killed when a rocket shell they found while playing on the ground burst at home, according to Kashmore-Kandhkot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Rohil Khosa. The victims included five children, two women, and two adults from the same household, stated a report in agencies. In addition to the dead, he stated that five more people were hurt in the explosion and sent to the hospital. ""This is an area on the riverine belt and the rocket shell must have been left there by dacoits who hide out deep into the riverine belt areas,"" Khoso stated. According to the SSP, the police had arrived at the scene, additional investigation was in progress, and the Kandhkot Civil Hospital had been declared in ""emergency"" status. Former foreign minister and chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari tweeted that several criminal gangs have found refuge in the riverine areas of Sindh and Punjab and urged the government to rid the area of such individuals.",world,india,0.5236139630390144,487,18,27.055555555555557,41.92

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

217,10:55:09,"Killed by Hamas, Israeli filmmaker was inspired by border horrors",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/killed-by-hamas-israeli-filmmaker-was-inspired-by-border-horrors/articleshow/105208855.cms,"Synopsis Five weeks after his death, ""The Boy"" is being screened to audiences in Tel Aviv as a tribute to Winner. During a Nov. 11 screening, a scene involving characters taking shelter during a rocket raid drew cries and tears from audience members. AFP In 2008, when Yahav Winner was 22, his best friend's father died in front of him, killed by a rocket fired out of the Gaza Strip by the Hamas militant group. Almost 15 years later, as an established filmmaker, Winner made a short movie called ""The Boy"", looking to come to terms with the trauma that had marked him for life. But just as the film was due to be released, Winner himself died at the hands of Hamas, killed on Oct. 7 when Palestinian gunmen burst out of Gaza and attacked southern Israeli communities, including the Kfar Aza kibbutz, where he lived with his wife Shaylee Atary and their baby daughter, Shaya. The family had taken refuge in their safe room, but when militants looked to smash through a window, Winner had held it tightly shut, giving time for Atary and Shaya to flee. ""We had a little glance, not even like a long goodbye, and he pushed a window against them, and I ran away with the baby, no shoes, no nothing on me,"" Atary told Reuters. Several days later, Atary learned that Winner had died next to the window he had held shut for so long, killed by militants who had fired grenades and bullets into the house. Five weeks after his death, ""The Boy"" is being screened to audiences in Tel Aviv as a tribute to Winner. During a Nov. 11 screening, a scene involving characters taking shelter during a rocket raid drew cries and tears from audience members. ""So the film is like a closure to his experience he went (through). And it's very weird he came back to the place where he saw Jimi Kdoshim die in front of him, murdered from the rocket, and then he was murdered,"" said Atary. ""I always think that it's a weird circle."" Atary and Winner, who had studied together in film school, were an artistic power couple in Kfar Aza, one of a number of small Israeli communities built along the border with Gaza. Winner was the director, and Atary was his editor, making all of their films locally on a limited budget, hiring local residents as actors and extras instead of casting professionals. ""He was the only opinion that mattered to me. Even if everybody says it sucks, if he says it's good, maybe there is something in it,"" said Atary. ""It's very hard for me to understand that the only person that matters to me, in a matter of art, and friend, is ... gone,"" she said, holding back tears. Atary is still in the midst of editing ""Kibbutz Legend"", Winner's fifth and final film, which they completed shooting shortly before his death. In the movie, both Winner and Atary, who was pregnant at the time, act as the leads, and the supporting cast were all friends and family from Kfar Aza. Many of the cast members were also killed in the Gaza militant rampage on Oct. 7. ""So all of the people I see on the screen, I see the trauma, but because of that, I feel the necessity to do that film,"" said Atary. ""And I will show the place that we once had.

218,08:30:43,Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/gaza-war-pushes-tumultuous-israel-turkey-ties-into-deep-freezer?traffic_source=rss,"The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly of Israel. Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments. “Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,” the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the , a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The vessel was trying to break Israel’s blockade and deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. It was the culmination of a sharp dive in ties since October 7. On October 20, Erdogan said Israel’s operations amounted to “genocide”. At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a “war criminal” over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas’s cross-border assault three weeks earlier. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital. But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints. By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. State-owned Turkish Airlines started direct flights to Israel in 1986. In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time. From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. Two defence agreements were signed in 1996, paving the way for a strategic military partnership that included the upgrading of F-4 and F-5 jet aircraft, M-60 tanks and helicopters. Turkey, Israel and the US participated in joint aerial and naval exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean until 2009. Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in 2002. Erdogan visited Tel Aviv as prime minister three years later, presenting himself as a possible mediator between Israelis and Palestinians. In 2004, Erdogan condemned Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as “state-sponsored terrorism”, reflecting wider Turkish support for Palestinians, and Hamas in particular. Yet, during high-level visits in 2006 and 2007, Turkey worked to resolve tensions between Syria and Israel over Syria’s involvement in Lebanon and support for Palestinian groups and Hezbollah. In 2007, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul offered to help secure the release of three captured soldiers: Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas from 2006 to 2011, and Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev who were both held by Hezbollah from 2006 until their bodies were returned to Israel in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres at the time thanked Turkey, as well as Egypt and Germany, for helping release Shalit. The three-week war on Gaza in 2008-2009 reinforced tensions between Turkey and Israel. The assault on the Turkish aid ship Mavi Marmara led to a diplomatic falling-out, which saw Ankara expel the Israeli ambassador. Official ties remained frosty until 2016 when the two countries agreed to a compensation deal and a pathway to normalising relations. But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite rekindled diplomatic tensions, business between Turkey and Israel continued to boom. Between 2010, the year of the Mavi Marmara incident, and 2021, trade volume more than doubled from $3.4bn to $8.4bn. Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last year, Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara and ambassadors were appointed in both capitals. Erdogan met Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in September and they both pledged greater cooperation between their countries. The horrors of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Erdogan’s hardening rhetoric, however, appear to have stalled those plans. Last month, he cancelled any . Early in the current war, Erdogan spoke to multiple world leaders and between Hamas and Israel. That suggestion, said Piccoli of Teneo, appeared to have evaporated in recent days.",top,united states of america,0.4310487200660611,1211,47,25.76595744680851,44.712
219,11:30:25,Morning Report — Democrats open to Speaker’s funding fallback,https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/4308412-democrats-open-to-speakers-funding-fallback/,"Whew. A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday. He called it “far from perfect” but said the proposal could work ( ). Under the two-track temporary compromise, the House would extend funding for military construction, veterans’ benefits, transportation, housing, urban development, agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and energy and water programs through Jan. 19. Funding for all other federal operations, including defense, would expire on Feb. 2. are elements of ’s request to Congress for a total of $105 billion in supplemental funding to assist Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security. The president asked for $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion in help for Israel (including $9.15 billion in humanitarian aid), $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the region and $13.6 billion to bolster the U.S. border with Mexico. Lawmakers suggest the aid debate may extend beyond November. : A Senate panel today will move a resolution to try to break the monthslong hold of Sen. (R-Ala.) over the administration’s military nominations. Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. , sensing an opening to run ahead of rival Florida Gov. , will spend $10 million on campaign ads across Iowa and New Hampshire beginning in the first week of December. Haley’s move comes as she fights to emerge as the clear alternative to former to represent the GOP against Biden next fall. DeSantis stands as Haley’s strongest competition for her party’s second-place slot, although the Florida governor’s campaign has shown signs of financial strain following a tumultuous summer ( ). As the number of 2024 GOP primary candidates dwindles, fresh questions are emerging about the race in the leadup to the Iowa caucuses. about the winnowing GOP field, including whether Haley can overtake DeSantis, and whether former New Jersey Gov. (R) will stay in the race after Sen. (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that he was suspending his campaign. DeSantis’s campaign is moving three of its top officials to Iowa this week, a move that comes as the governor is increasingly staking his hopes on a strong performance in the GOP’s first nominating contest. His allied super PAC, Never Back Down, has invested substantial resources in the state, hoping that a strong performance there will catapult him into contention. The candidate himself has devoted a major amount of his time to Iowa too; his campaign said DeSantis has visited 92 of the state’s 99 counties. He also recently won the endorsement of Gov.

The former president’s escalating rhetoric has drawn comparisons from critics to dictators from decades ago and put Republican leaders on the spot as Trump remains on track to be the party’s nominee in 2024. Responding to public pressure and congressional calls for tougher rules and transparency, the Supreme Court Monday after news media investigations detailed loans, gifts and business alliances between some justices and individuals with interests in the court. The 15-page voluntary code is . In their announcement, justices said the court’s overall rules and principles are “not new.” that Monday’s “codification” is intended to quiet criticism and head off Senate interest in stepping in if the Supreme Court would not.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects roughly 100,000 Americans, most of whom are Black. The disease causes red blood cells to become sickle or c-shaped, clumping together and clogging blood vessels, causing pain and other complications. There is only one approved treatment that can cure sickle cell disease: a bone marrow transplant, for which finding a compatible donor can be difficult. The new treatment, known as exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), takes a patient’s own stem cells and edits them to produce more fetal hemoglobin, an abundance of which has been observed to cause red blood cells to not “sickle” ( ). 🇨🇳 Flashback: Chinese President , 70, this week makes his 10th trip to the United States and his fifth as China’s top leader.

221,13:21:15,Bestselling spiritual author Marianne Williamson presses on with against-the-odds presidential run,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/12/bestselling-spiritual-author-marianne-williamson-p/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,"Back Print By Luis Andres Henao - Associated Press - Sunday, November 12, 2023 Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming for months across America - to audiences large and small, from churches and colleges to spiritual centers and soup kitchens - in a demanding schedule of appearances in her second tenacious, against-the-odds run for the presidency. The bestselling spiritual author and one-time advisor to Oprah Winfrey didn’t make it to the 2020 primaries in a wide-open Democratic field. Now she is running against a sitting president from her own party, and the Democratic establishment has closed ranks behind Joe Biden . Even some of her most devoted followers doubt she can be elected. So why is Williamson even running? She says it’s the faith she has in herself and the American people. “The most important things you do in life, not because there’s guaranteed success on some external level, but because you feel in your heart it’s the right thing to do,” Williamson , 71, said during an interview in New York City. She admits it has been grueling at times - not just the punishing campaign schedule, but more so the emotional bruising from a barrage of unflattering characterizations. For her, it’s “the ultimate challenge to have tough skin, but a soft and open heart,” she said. But Williamson worries that negative perceptions detract from her policy positions, which include financial reparations for Black Americans and creation of a Department of Peace. PHOTOS: Bestselling spiritual author Marianne Williamson presses on with against-the-odds presidential run “What are the words they use? Wacky, kooky, crystal lady,” she said, listing the names she’s called. “People will take one line out of a book, completely out of context. That has certainly been done to me. Plus, you know, they lie.” Born in Houston to a Jewish family, Judaism remains her core belief, and she also embraces universal spiritual themes, like loving one another. Williamson came into the spotlight with her popular 1992 book, “A Return to Love.” Oprah, highlighting it on her own site, wrote: “I have never been more moved by a book.” Williamson , the author of more than a dozen titles and well-known for supporting LGBTQ people, retains a legion of dedicated fans. Millions buy her books, attend her lectures and engage with her on TikTok. “She is extremely sincere in her beliefs, wise in many ways even,” said Issac Bailey, a communications professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who has written about Williamson’s faith and politics. “But she also has a streak that takes her beyond the pale.” He pointed to her wariness and sharp criticism of government vaccine mandates that came up during her last campaign. She later said she supports vaccines. “I’m a socially middle of the road Jew who goes to the doctor,” she said. “I’m not a crystal lady. I understand how important science is.” Williamson entered politics with an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014, then broke onto the national stage two years later as a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders’ failed presidential bid. In 2020, she entered the race herself. She acknowledges making what she calls “cringeworthy” comments back then, like how she would harness love to defeat former President Donald Trump. “Once they could be contextualized in a way that made me appear silly, there was almost no getting past the mockery,” she said. People may embrace quasi-spiritual language in their private lives, but if it’s from political candidates, it typically doesn’t play well on the campaign trail, said Galen Watts, a sociology and legal studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But this is not new territory for Williamson . For years, she has been under fire from intellectuals who call her theology too shallow, from politicians who mock her ideas, and more recently from some former campaign staff who say she’s irascible and is only trying to sell more books. She concedes that she probably swore more than she should have in her last campaign, but scoffs at the book-selling gibe. “The way to sell books is by going on a book tour, not a presidential campaign,” she said. “The way to sell books in my field is to never mention politics.” Some have questioned her political inexperience. But she dismisses that: “I reject the notion that only those whose careers have been ensconced in the car that drove us into this ditch are the only people we should consider qualified to drive us out of the ditch.” She announced her candidacy in February, and now is arguably the best-known Democrat still challenging Biden for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. But recent polls show her running more than 60 percentage points behind. She is well-liked by many young people, including Jose Serna, a 21-year-old at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Serna hopes she stays in the race “because she is illuminating the ideas that young people care about” including Medicare for all, equitable wages and affordable housing. “While I do believe that it is unlikely that Marianne will win the nomination, it is not because of her policies,” he said, citing a common complaint by Williamson and her backers about a lack of media attention. Marie Griffith, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, says there’s a practical reason why Williamson stands no chance of winning. “She has no connection that I know of to Democratic machine politics - meaning the people who raise all the money and make or break the political careers of those identifying as Democrats,” Griffith said. Williamson talks at times in religious and spiritual terms to describe America as a nation in need of confession and atonement. She worries about vast economic inequality and wants to declare a climate emergency. One of her signature policy proposals would have the government pay Black citizens reparations for centuries of enslavement and discrimination. She advocated for this in her 1997 book “The Healing of America.” Today, she proposes creating a council of Black academic, cultural and political leaders to disperse at least $1 trillion to Black Americans over two decades. Author and rabbi Jay Michaelson lauded Williamson for raising the issue before other political candidates, and for her work during the AIDS crisis, but in 2019 he wrote a scathing critique of her bid for president. He called her “selfish, deluded and dumb by denigrating science” and said she gives spiritually a bad name. Michaelson, in a recent interview, said he agreed with Williamson “that our spiritual commitments and our religious commitments should impact our political lives.” But he says she will remain a fringe candidate because some of her policy positions are too radical for many. “To say, ‘We need a politics of love’ without explaining what that is,” he said. “Or that we need a new paradigm, or that we need some kind of revolution - that doesn’t play on Main Street.” Williamson denies denigrating science and disputes broader criticisms of her campaign. “This idea that I am unserious - my campaign is the one talking about one in four Americans living with medical debt. My campaign is the one talking about the fact that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “My campaign is the most serious campaign.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
