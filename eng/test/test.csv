13:19:19,,Jewish protesters and allies stage sit-in at California federal building demanding Gaza cease-fire,https://www.nsnews.com/religion-news/jewish-protesters-and-allies-stage-sit-in-at-california-federal-building-demanding-gaza-cease-fire-7827452,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by Jewish peace activists calling for a cease fire in Gaza staged a sit-in inside of the federal building in Oakland, California, leading to multiple arrests. People wore T-shirts reading ""Jews Say Cease-fire Now” and carried banners that read “Not in Our Name” and “Let Gaza Live” in the rotunda of the Rondald V. Dellums Federal building on Monday evening. Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the protest organizers, posted online that dozens of people had been taken into custody by 9 p.m. Protesters were escorted outside of the building by U.S. Department of Homeland Security police. Messages were sent early Tuesday to the department and to Oakland police asking how many people were arrested and on what charges. “There is no other choice,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of Berkeley told KNTV-TV when explaining why she was at the sit-in. “How many people do we have to kill before we arrive at a cease fire?” The protest was part of a growing number across the country following fighting triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel , whose response has led to thousands of deaths — and much destruction — across Gaza. On Monday, hundreds of Jewish peace activists and their allies converged at a major train station in downtown Chicago during rush hour blocking the entrance to the Israeli consulate and demanding U.S. support for an Israel cease-fire. Jewish Voice for Peace led a similar sit-in in New York City’s Grand Central Station on Oct. 27, where a sea of protesters filled the main concourse during evening rush hour, chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. At least 200 demonstrators were detained by New York police officers. The Associated Press",top,canada
11:37:54,,Ableton Live 12 arrives – here’s what’s new,https://musictech.com/news/gear/ableton-live-12-daw/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ableton-live-12-daw,"has announced Ableton Live 12, the next edition of its hugely popular flagship DAW, that’s set to launch in 2024 with a beta version being made publicly available soon. The DAW, arriving early next year, will see an array of improvements in its usability and accessibility. The release will also feature developments in its navigation functions to help streamline the production process, alongside the addition of new exciting composition tools, devices and more. At a glance, Ableton Live 12 brings significant visual enhancements, aiding the visually impaired with screen reader support and extensive keyboard shortcuts for a more accessible music-making experience. The update focuses on intuitive navigation, introducing tags and a sound similarity system to simplify finding sounds, effects, and plugins. It also has a keen focus on aiding song composition, with new MIDI Clip options expanding composition features, including automatic key alignment with diverse scale options. New powerful devices such as Meld, Roar, and Granulator III offer experimental sonic capabilities and creative modulation options. Let’s take a more detailed dive into what’s new and improved in Ableton Live 12: MIDI Composition Tools Ableton Live 12 is introducing MIDI Transformations and Generators that suggest connections between successive notes and chords, simulate guitar strums, can generate algorithms to create melodies, rhythms, and chords adhering to user-defined constraints. These suggestions are created within constraints set by you, the user. The MIDI Editor now provides a range of improvements, letting you manipulate notes with more flexibility than before. You can rearrange selected notes by pitch, velocity, or duration. You can stretch, split, chop, or join notes in interesting ways, adjust note velocities more seamlessly, transpose notes into scales, or introduce intervals chromatically or in key. Live’s Keys and Scales feature now lets you select a key in the Control Bar, which shows the corresponding notes in any created clip. Scale highlighting serves as a guiding tool for clip editing, aiding in the transformation and generation of musical ideas using the clip scale. Additionally, it enables syncing the scale of MIDI devices and instruments to the played clip, enhancing the overall musical cohesion. Also, tuning capabilities have been expanded beyond Western 12-tone equal temperament system scales, allowing for alternative tunings such as Persian and Arabic scales within Live’s devices and MPE-capable plugins. What is Meld in Ableton Live 12? Meld is a new device in Ableton Live 12 that’s a bi-timbral and MPE-capable instrument offering extensive sound-shaping capabilities. It boasts two powerful macro oscillators that allow for diverse wave shaping. There’s also an advanced modulation matrix. MusicTech sat down with Ableton earlier this year and was shown a demo of this awesome new instrument, and we saw how an artist used Meld to create an entire track, inclusive of drums, showcasing its versatility in generating experimental and textured sounds. What is Roar in Ableton Live 12? Roar is a new, advanced saturation effect that offers various visualiser options and a fascinating feedback mode. This feature-rich tool allows users to craft anything from delicate subtle warmth to audacious sound alterations. With three saturation stages usable in different setups and an expansive modulation matrix, Roar provides versatility for creative audio processing. What’s new in Granulator III? Granulator III, Ableton Live’s co-creator ’s updated granular instrument, introduces MPE functionality, granting nuanced control over note modulation aspects like bend, vibrato, and glissando. Real-time audio capture allows immediate manipulation, ideal for live performance. Featuring three granulator types and comprehensive MPE support, it enriches expressive sound manipulation. User Interface and Navigation Improvements Ableton is also aiming to make its new DAW a more pleasant experience for the eye, with a range of new colour-coding options and new themes, such as night mode, to make for a clearer interface. On the mixer, there’s now detailed mixer gain staging, transitioning via green to orange gradients, so you can see when your sound is close to redlining with visual precision. In Ableton Live 12, the Arrangement and Mixer can now be viewed within a single window. There are also new zoom functions, so you can have one window zoomed in more than another, which is great if you work with two screens and want to adjust audio in detail and make big changes to the project at the same time. The update introduces Stacked Detail Views, too, offering a comprehensive overview of a track’s elements simultaneously, streamlining workflow by presenting devices, Clip Editor, automation, and parameters within one view. Browser Tagging and Sound Similarity Another cool addition in Ableton Live 12 is improvements to the browser. There is set to be a new system for finding sounds or presets from plugins, so you can type in, say, ‘airy strings’ or ‘gritty bass’ and it will find results from sounds and even presets within plugins, both stock and third party. The new Sound Similarity Search feature means you can find a sample and Ableton will find similar sounds and instrument presets based on timbre, making the sound selection process much more streamlined. Live 12 also has a huge emphasis on accessibility, providing control through assistive technologies like screen readers and offering new keyboard shortcuts that navigate almost every part of the software, enhancing the user experience for a broader range of users. Ableton Live 12 is set to launch early next year. A public beta version will soon be available although a launch date for this is unknown currently.",top,united kingdom
11:30:25,Alexis Simendinger and Kristina Karisch,Morning Report — Democrats open to Speaker’s funding fallback,https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/4308412-democrats-open-to-speakers-funding-fallback/,"Whew. A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday. He called it “far from perfect” but said the proposal could work ( ). Under the two-track temporary compromise, the House would extend funding for military construction, veterans’ benefits, transportation, housing, urban development, agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and energy and water programs through Jan. 19. Funding for all other federal operations, including defense, would expire on Feb. 2. are elements of ’s request to Congress for a total of $105 billion in supplemental funding to assist Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security. The president asked for $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion in help for Israel (including $9.15 billion in humanitarian aid), $7.4 billion in funding for Taiwan and the region and $13.6 billion to bolster the U.S. border with Mexico. Lawmakers suggest the aid debate may extend beyond November. : A Senate panel today will move a resolution to try to break the monthslong hold of Sen. (R-Ala.) over the administration’s military nominations. Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. , sensing an opening to run ahead of rival Florida Gov. , will spend $10 million on campaign ads across Iowa and New Hampshire beginning in the first week of December. Haley’s move comes as she fights to emerge as the clear alternative to former to represent the GOP against Biden next fall. DeSantis stands as Haley’s strongest competition for her party’s second-place slot, although the Florida governor’s campaign has shown signs of financial strain following a tumultuous summer ( ). As the number of 2024 GOP primary candidates dwindles, fresh questions are emerging about the race in the leadup to the Iowa caucuses. about the winnowing GOP field, including whether Haley can overtake DeSantis, and whether former New Jersey Gov. (R) will stay in the race after Sen. (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that he was suspending his campaign. DeSantis’s campaign is moving three of its top officials to Iowa this week, a move that comes as the governor is increasingly staking his hopes on a strong performance in the GOP’s first nominating contest. His allied super PAC, Never Back Down, has invested substantial resources in the state, hoping that a strong performance there will catapult him into contention. The candidate himself has devoted a major amount of his time to Iowa too; his campaign said DeSantis has visited 92 of the state’s 99 counties. He also recently won the endorsement of Gov. (R). t four possible alternative presidential candidates — from , who is running as an independent, to Sen.

The former president’s escalating rhetoric has drawn comparisons from critics to dictators from decades ago and put Republican leaders on the spot as Trump remains on track to be the party’s nominee in 2024. Responding to public pressure and congressional calls for tougher rules and transparency, the Supreme Court Monday after news media investigations detailed loans, gifts and business alliances between some justices and individuals with interests in the court. The 15-page voluntary code is . In their announcement, justices said the court’s overall rules and principles are “not new.” that Monday’s “codification” is intended to quiet criticism and head off Senate interest in stepping in if the Supreme Court would not. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair (D-Ill.) but “falls short.” he said. Meanwhile in New York City Monday, a lawyer for Trump in his civil fraud trial said the former president will “very soon” file for a mistrial based, she hinted, based on assertions that the judge and a court clerk are biased against her client. Trump’s team on Monday began to present a defense in a $250 million lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General (D) alleging a decade of fraud by Trump and the Trump Organization in valuations of real estate and other holdings ( ). Trump’s defense team began presenting its case Monday, with co-defendant testifying in glowing terms about the company’s properties. Trump Jr. testified two weeks ago as James’s lawyers presented their case, distancing himself from the organization’s financial statements. On Monday, he was not asked about the financial statements and instead focused on touting various Trump locales. The remarks appeared aimed at bolstering the defense’s argument that the asset valuations on financial statements were not false but, instead, reflected the properties’ real values ( ). Trump’s legal team asked a federal judge to televise his election obstruction trial, echoing media outlets that argue the American public should be able to watch the case in real time. Typically, trials in federal court are not televised and Justice Department special counsel objected Monday to Trump’s eagerness for cameras, arguing in a filing that Trump’s legal team failed to cite ( ). : Ex-Trump allies detail efforts to overturn election in Georgia plea videos. Trump’s sister, , a former federal judge until 2019, died at age 86 at her Manhattan apartment, where she was found Monday ( ). The former president and his sister, , 81, are now the last of five Trump siblings. Nothing about the plight of Palestinian civilians and children in Gaza appears to have improved as of Tuesday as Israeli forces bombard southern Gaza Israel on Monday was no closer to the victory over Hamas that Prime Minister described Sunday during U.S. television interviews. Hostages remain under Hamas control, but Washington Post columnist between Israel and the militant group to release “most” of Israeli women and children held captive since Oct. 7. Hamas has indicated it is ready to release 70 Israeli women and children, by one of its officials on the group’s Telegram channel, which was cited by Monday. The number of Palestinian women and young people who might be released from prisons in Israel is unclear, Ignatius wrote. The United Nations projected it would run out of fuel Tuesday in Gaza, . Israel Defense Forces encircled where conditions for medical personnel, patients and their families were described in apocalyptic terms without fuel, water, sanitation, food and medical supplies. The Al Shifa hospital was encircled by tanks as Israeli forces maintain that the facility serves as a shield for Hamas underground tunnels and serves as a headquarters for fighters. Hamas denies it. The Gaza Health Ministry says 32 patients died in the hospital this week without fuel and supplies, including that succumbed without electricity for incubators. The World Health Organization warned of a humanitarian and public health crisis and said Al Shifa Hospital was “ .” Gaza’s hospitals “must be protected,” .

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects roughly 100,000 Americans, most of whom are Black. The disease causes red blood cells to become sickle or c-shaped, clumping together and clogging blood vessels, causing pain and other complications. There is only one approved treatment that can cure sickle cell disease: a bone marrow transplant, for which finding a compatible donor can be difficult. The new treatment, known as exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), takes a patient’s own stem cells and edits them to produce more fetal hemoglobin, an abundance of which has been observed to cause red blood cells to not “sickle” ( ). 🇨🇳 Flashback: Chinese President , 70, this week makes his 10th trip to the United States and his fifth as China’s top leader.

10:05:00,Grist staff,How does climate change threaten where you live? A region-by-region guide.,https://grist.org/climate/national-climate-assessment-2023-us-regional-impacts-summary/,"Every four years, the federal government is required to gather up the leading research on how climate change is affecting Americans, boil it all down, and then publish a National Climate Assessment. This report, a collaboration between 13 federal agencies and a wide array of academic researchers, takes stock of just how severe global warming has become and meticulously breaks down its effects by geography — 10 distinct regions in total, encompassing all of the country’s states and territories. The last report, which the Trump administration tried to bury when it came out in 2018, was the most dire since the first assessment was published in 2000. Until now. The Fifth National Climate Assessment, released on Tuesday by the Biden administration, is unique for its focus on the present. Like previous versions, it looks at how rising temperatures will change the United States in decades to come, but it also makes clear that the rising seas, major hurricanes, and other disastrous consequences of climate change predicted in prior reports have begun to arrive. The effects are felt in every region. In the 1980s, the country saw a billion-dollar disaster every four months on average. Now, there’s one billion-dollar disaster every three weeks, according to the assessment. All of the many extreme weather events that hit the U.S., from the tiniest flood to the biggest hurricane, cost around $150 billion every year — and that’s likely a huge underestimate. “Climate change is here,” said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration during a briefing on the report. “Whether it’s wildfires or floods or drought, whether it’s extreme heat or storms, we know that climate change has made its way into our lives and it’s unfolding as predicted.” The report outlines steps every level of government can take to combat the climate crisis. And it takes stock of progress that has been made over the past four years. There’s good news on that front: President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress have managed to pass historic climate measures that reduce the country’s carbon footprint between 32 and 51 percent by 2035, putting the U.S. closer to meeting its emissions targets under the global climate treaty known as the Paris Agreement. A number of have passed climate policies that can serve as a blueprint for what actions the rest of the country, and indeed the world at large, needs to take in the coming years. California’s and the Northeast’s are two examples. The National Climate Assessment makes clear we’ve got a lot of work to do. These cities and states are leading the way. Despite this progress, climate impacts — oppressive in the Southeast that linger for weeks on end, in the Southwest, in the Atlantic basin, wildfires of along the West Coast — are accelerating. That’s the nature of human-caused climate change: The consequences of a century and a half of burning fossil fuels are arriving now. Even if we stopped burning oil and gas tomorrow, some degree of planetary warming is baked in. This reality, the report says, leaves the country no choice but to adapt, and quickly. “We need to be moving much faster,” the Biden administration said. “We need more transformative adaptation actions to keep pace with climate change.” The Grist staff, located all over the country, reviewed the assessment to provide you with the most important takeaways for your region. Here they are. One of the joys of living in Alaska is being able to walk through thick brush without fearing that a tiny, eight-legged critter could latch onto you at any moment and give you a debilitating illness like Lyme disease (though, sure, grizzly bears are a worry). According to the assessment, that’s about to change: The western black-legged tick is creeping north, and it’s poised to establish a new home in the country’s largest state. As Alaska warms two or three times faster than the rest of the world, it’s making life harder for many of the 730,000 people who live there, particularly Indigenous and rural residents who rely on hunting and fishing for food. are sweltering in the Bering Sea. Salmon are , leaving fish racks and freezers empty in Yup’ik and Athabascan villages along the Yukon River. Melting sea ice, extreme ocean warming, and toxic algae blooms are unraveling food webs, killing seabirds and marine mammals. It’s not pretty. And it’s not all happening at sea. The ground beneath Alaskans’ feet is . Eighty percent of the state sits on permafrost, much of which is thawing. In Denali National Park, a melting underground glacier triggered a landslide in 2021 that forced the park’s main road to close for a few years. Add freak storms, flooding, and erosion to the mix, and Alaska Native communities face nearly $5 billion in infrastructure damage over the next 50 years, the report says. There are a few bright spots. Higher elevations could see more snow, not less, and Alaska’s growing season is getting longer — a boon for a fledgling agricultural industry. Still, if you migrate north to start a farm, don’t think you’ll have found a refuge from wildfires, even in the Arctic. Just Google “zombie fires.” Every month on the sixth day after a new moon, generations of Palauans have ventured out under the hot late-afternoon sun to toss their nets into seagrass meadows to capture rabbit fish. In 2021, the low tide didn’t come. Neither did the fish. The Indigenous fishers in Palau were left waiting, wondering if the higher tide would ever ebb. It’s not yet clear whether climate change is to blame. But what is clear from the climate assessment is that rising sea levels, worsening storms, and other climate-related effects will transform the lives of nearly 1.9 million people who live in the states, nations, and territories that make up the U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands, many of them Indigenous peoples who have contributed little to climate change yet are bearing the worst of its impacts. Low-lying atolls in the Marshall Islands are already disappearing. The islands that remain risk losing their drinking water as saltwater intrudes on thin freshwater aquifers. In American Samoa, tuna canneries could see as much as a 40 percent drop in their catch by 2050 compared with the 2000s, according to the report, if carbon emissions don’t fall fast enough. In Hawaiʻi, a 3.2-foot rise in sea level could displace 20,000 people and cost $19 billion. That same scenario would affect 58 percent of the built environment on the island of Guam. Maui residents still reeling from the horror of August’s wildfires can expect more drought on the leeward coast that could provide tinder for more flames. Already, fires burn a greater proportion of land area in U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands than on the continental U.S. Health care, already a longstanding challenge in the islands, is expected to get worse, as temperatures rise and mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika proliferate. One study found 82 percent of heat deaths in Honolulu can already be attributed to climate change. If you’ve ever driven through Iowa, Illinois, or Indiana, you won’t be surprised to learn that the region produces almost a third of the world’s corn and soybeans. In fact, there are so many crops getting , water is evaporating off them and cooling summer days in parts of the Midwest, like central Wisconsin, countering some of the warming from climate change. But rapid swings between flooding and , along with the spread of corn earworms, Japanese beetles, and other pests, are hurting these staple crops and the . Climate change, the report says, has also led to smaller harvests of , a staple that’s central to the identity of the Indigenous Anishinaabe. The region is getting more rain, and that’s promising for wheat production, but bad news for aging dams, roads, bridges, and wastewater facilities, which are already getting overwhelmed by water. The amount of precipitation during the 1 percent of rainiest days in the Midwest has increased by 45 percent since 1958, the report says. The Great Lakes, the crown jewel of the Midwest, are among the fastest-warming lakes in the world, with climate change stressing out an ecosystem already plagued by and invasive species and also reducing populations of walleye and trout. Warmer winters mean there’s less ice atop lakes and ponds, threatening from Minnesota to Michigan. Those less-harsh winters are also expanding the ranges of disease-carrying ticks and mosquitoes. Lyme disease has exploded in the Midwest to the point that it’s now endemic, and by 2050, the Ohio Valley may see more than 200 cases of West Nile virus every year. Another once-rare phenomenon that’ll become more common: wildfire smoke. Midwesterners got a preview this summer when smoke poured in from the fires in Canada, inundating with “very unhealthy” air. , When it comes to climate-fueled flooding, the 67 million residents of the U.S. Northeast are especially at risk, and the region’s aging stormwater and sewage infrastructure only makes matters worse. This summer, historic flooding in , , and killed multiple people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, a preview of flooding-related dangers to come. Extreme precipitation events have increased 60 percent across the entire region, which the report says could be due to a combination of more tropical storms and a warmer, wetter atmosphere. No other region in the U.S. has seen such a marked increase in rainfall. But climate impacts within the Northeast extend far beyond flooding. Days when real-feel temperatures are over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will triple by 2050 under an intermediate warming scenario, the report said, and communities that lack access to reliable and affordable air conditioning will see their health and general well-being decline as a result. The report also warns that states along the coast will have to confront the effects of warming water on marine species, fish stocks, and tourism — if they aren’t doing so already. In the Gulf of Maine, for example, lobster, oysters, and other shellfish are expected to decline. Animals that can migrate, such as right whales, will abandon the gulf for cooler waters north of the state. Sea bass, some types of squid, and other temperate marine species, on the other hand, will flourish. Warming winter nights are allowing damaging forest pests, such as the emerald ash borer and the woolly adelgid, to extend their ranges into colder latitudes and plague new ecosystems. Rising seas along the coastline will push homes and infrastructure inland, raising the controversial question of who gets to leave and who can stay. Already, home buyout programs and multibillion-dollar flood protection initiatives are underway in New Jersey and New York. , In parts of the country like southwestern Nebraska, it’s not uncommon for to fall from the sky during thunderstorms in the summer months. Unfortunately for people in the northern Great Plains, it’s likely to get worse: The region will experience the largest increase in hail risk, according to the report, along with more storms. By 2071, days with hail of two inches in diameter or more could increase threefold and cover almost nine times more ground. Hail that size can smash windows, dent cars, and cause severe injuries. The report highlights a shift in the region’s water, so vital for the landlocked landscape spanning Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. Decreasing snowpack could cut short winter tourism seasons and reduce available surface water, putting more stress on limited groundwater. At the same time, more flooding and extreme weather could hit communities with the fewest resources to respond. Two storms in 2018 destroyed nearly 600 homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, with half not repaired a year later. Hotter temperatures have already limited harvests of traditional foods and medicine used by many indigenous nations. That includes wild turnips and chokecherries, culturally significant plants for the Lakota people. Rising temperatures have also dried the soil, raising wildfire risks. In the Great Plains grasslands, the number of wildfires has already more than doubled since 1985. Forest fires in Montana and Wyoming have shot up almost ninefold since the 1970s. All these trends are likely to get worse. But these problems might not be enough to scare off newcomers trying to get away from droughts and wildfires elsewhere in the country. The report suggests that fewer cold snaps and a longer growing season in the Great Plains could lure people migrating from other regions in search of a new place to live. Climate change might be putting an end to “Juneuary,” the term for the Northwest’s chilly early summers. Take the infamous “ ” that smothered Washington and Oregon in late June 2021. The searing heat melted electrical equipment in Portland, buckled roads outside Seattle, and led to nearly a thousand deaths in the two states (and British Columbia). Without climate change, a heat wave that intense would’ve been “ ,” according to one study cited. The report says the Northwest can expect hotter heat waves — and more deaths. Heat and wildfire smoke in the region have already led to thousands of deaths since 2018, when the last National Climate Assessment was published. Extreme heat is worse in like the Albina neighborhood in Portland, where temperatures can reach 13 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the rest of the city. Most of the region’s drinking water has come from melting snow, stored in mountain ranges like the Cascades that run through Washington and Oregon, or the Sawtooth range in Idaho. But warmer winters are turning more , leading to in the winter and dry rivers in the summer. Glaciers are melting, even atop iconic . On the coast, rising waters pose problems. The town of Taholah on the Quinault Reservation along Washington’s northwest coast could see the ocean climb as much as 1.2 feet by 2050. The Quinault Indian Nation recently started to move many of its homes and government buildings farther inland. The report warns that the cost and complexity of managed retreat might make it difficult for other coastal communities. Diminishing streams could be troublesome for numerous hydroelectric dams. Local and state governments might need to find new sources of energy to power the region’s electric cars and brand-new air conditioners — without relying on the fossil fuels that got us into this mess. The sunny and fast-growing Southeast is on a collision course with climate change. Its cities have gobbled up more than 1.3 million acres of exceptionally biodiverse land since 1985, and more than a million people have moved to Florida alone since 2018. These newcomers are sitting ducks for worsening disasters, especially floods. The Southeast has seen almost two dozen hurricanes make landfall since 2018, and these monster storms are ballooning to full strength much faster as they cross a hotter Gulf of Mexico. The slow creep of sea-level rise has also led to more frequent tidal flooding in coastal cities like Miami. That’s bad news for the millions of people who have bought waterfront homes over the past few decades. To say the region is ill-prepared for this era of climate disaster would be an understatement. Many Southeastern cities are plagued with flimsy manufactured housing, antiquated drainage systems, and decades-old power grids. Heat stroke will become a bigger danger for outdoor workers, and more blackouts will knock out life-saving AC units in big cities. Louisiana saw more than 20 such events between 2011 and 2021. Warmer spring temperatures will also increase pollen counts in cities like Atlanta, worsening air quality. All these impacts will be more dangerous for the region’s Black residents, who live in hotter and more flood-prone places than their neighbors. The region’s declining rural areas also face existential threats, as industries find themselves unprepared for a warmer world. Farmers of cash crops such as citrus and soybeans, for instance, are fighting a four-front war against drought, flooding, heat, and wildfires, which all reduce annual yields. Extreme weather will continue sapping these moribund economies, leading to more out-migration and urban growth. The southern Great Plains encompasses a stunning variety of terrain, from the windy plains of Kansas to the swamps of East Texas. In some parts of the region, annual precipitation is as low as 10 inches, and in other parts it’s as high as 50 inches. Accordingly, the impact of climate change looks very different depending on where you are. In the high plains of Oklahoma, drought has drained rivers and aquifers for rural communities, but residents of large Texas cities like Houston and Dallas have to worry about floods overwhelming asphalt streets and clogged storm drains. Kansas and Oklahoma don’t face the risk of the billion-dollar disasters that plague Texas, but the report finds that earlier springs in those two landlocked states have “reduced plant growth and diminished productivity” for all-important wheat and sorghum crops. Lyme disease-bearing ticks have started to appear even in the depths of winter, when they’re supposed to be hibernating. Energy is the backbone of the region’s economy, especially in Texas. This massive industry has helped accelerate climate change, and it’s also vulnerable to climate shifts: Hurricanes and increasingly large rain storms could knock out plants and refineries on the Gulf Coast. Agriculture and livestock, the other main industries, are also vulnerable to droughts: Dry spells in Kansas and Oklahoma have “increased labor demands for feeding, forcing producers to sell genetically valuable animals,” the report notes. These shifts could cost billions of dollars to the region’s economy. The report also highlights threats to another mainstay of life in the South: football. Extreme heat and flooding could endanger athletes and force schools to postpone games. This already happened in 2021, when Hurricane Ida forced the Tulane University football team to play a game at the University of Oklahoma instead of at home in New Orleans. A succession of droughts, fires, and heat waves has thrown the Southwest’s economy into turmoil over the past decade, upending housing markets and stalwart industries like agriculture. The most visible disaster in the region is wildfire. The already hot and dry Southwest is getting hotter and drier, which makes it easy for big fires to rage for weeks and even months, destroying thousands of homes. It also means that “fire season” now lasts roughly all year, as 2021’s Marshall Fire in Colorado demonstrated. The cost of putting out wildfires in California exceeded $2 billion that year, according to the report. As a result of all this damage, insurance costs are skyrocketing for everyone, even city dwellers who aren’t directly threatened by blazes. On California’s coast, rising seas have eaten away at bluffs, causing stretches of road to collapse into the water. The authors of the report write that a rash of marine heat waves in the Pacific between 2013 and 2020 caused massive die-offs in the state’s salmon fishery and beached starving sea lions. Under the worst warming scenarios, the Pacific sardine fishery could migrate as much as 500 miles north. In the desert, farms, ranches, and cities have drained reservoirs on big waterways like the Colorado River. Rural residents in California and Arizona are seeing their wells go dry during increasingly severe droughts, thanks in large part to thirsty nut and dairy farms that have sucked up groundwater. And drought has been even more challenging for the many Native American tribes. The Navajo Nation, for instance, lacks legal access to the Colorado River, so most residents haul their water by truck. Building new water infrastructure is more than 70 times as expensive on the reservation as it would be in the average U.S. town, according to the report The climate impacts facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands don’t differ wildly from those of the continental states: Storms will strengthen, coastlines will shrink, temperatures will rise, and rainfall will diminish. What’s distinct about how the U.S. Caribbean territories will experience these hazards (apart from the islands’ location in a hurricane-prone ocean) are the economic and social conditions that have already made the region’s disasters more deadly — conditions that can be traced to the territories’ history as de facto U.S. colonies. More than 40 percent of Puerto Rico’s 3 million residents live below the poverty level, as do almost 20 percent of the 87,000 people living in the U.S. Virgin Islands. After Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, mortality rates were higher for the elderly and those with the lowest household incomes. Studies found that nearly 3,000 excess deaths occurred after the storm because people lacked access to basic services. That resource imbalance also shows itself in the dearth of necessary data available to assess current and future climate impacts in the region, especially in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The report is full of footnotes conceding that data was unavailable for the Caribbean territories. Without improved social and economic resilience, U.S. Caribbean residents will continue to be uniquely vulnerable to storms, floods, and heat. “We may be facing more extreme hurricanes, but if we have the capacity, the quality of life, the social conditions to be prepared, it wouldn’t be that catastrophic,” said Pablo Méndez-Lázaro, lead chapter author and associate professor of environmental health at the University of Puerto Rico. “If we keep having a huge amount of people living under the poverty level, with preexisting conditions, exposed to flood areas, we will face another María.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A Revanth Reddy.(ANI) “Everybody knows who he is working for...Since Congress won in Karnataka, Asaduddin Owaisi and KCR are sad which means they made efforts for BJP to win,” the Congress chief told ANI. Catch the full coverage of the Telangana elections. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Reddy further challenged Owaisi and his party to help them defeat the BJP in the Goshamahal Assembly Constituency. ""That's the reason why you don't need to discuss BJP's Team B and if you have the daring then help in defeating BJP in Goshamahal Assembly Constituency then people will get to know your real intention,"" Reddy was quoted as saying by the news agency. Owaisi and Reddy have lately been engaged in a war of words during the campaign for the coming Assembly elections in Telangana. On Monday, Owaisi had accused Reddy of doing ""dog whistle politics"" targeting the minority class. Owaisi had said that Reddy had nothing substantial to criticize and was resorting to personal attacks. ""You (Revanth Reddy) don't have anything to criticise against us. You speak about our clothes and beards and attack us. It is called dog whistle politics. You are an RSS puppet. There is no difference between the BJP and the Congress,"" Asaduddin Owaisi said at a public rally in Hyderabad. The verbal spat started when Reddy took a swipe at Owaisi, alleging that the AIMIM leader “wears a khaki knicker under his sherwani”. Both Congress and AIMIM have been trying to label each other as the ‘B’ team of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Even cutouts depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi controlling Owaisi and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao were put up in Hyderabad last week. ""Telangana PCC chief started as an RSS member wearing a chaddi and then went to ABVP, then joined Telugu Desam and now comes to Congress. Someone said it right that Congress's Gandhi Bhavan is captured by Mohan Bhagwat and will run Congress however he wants,"" the AIMIM chief said. The ruling BRS had also stepped up its attack on Congress, with the party's working president and minister K T Rama Rao accusing the grand old party of using minority communities as a vote bank. Telangana will undergo assembly elections on November 30. The counting of votes, along with those of four other poll-bound states, has been scheduled for December 3. ""Exciting news!

11:07:39,Joy Anigbogu,"Don’t Expect Credible Elections In 2027 Under APC, Tinubu, Timi Frank Tells Nigerians",https://independent.ng/dont-expect-credible-elections-in-2027-under-apc-tinubu-timi-frank-tells-nigerians/,"LAGOS – Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, on Tuesday, called on Nigerians not to expect free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2027 under the administration of President Bola Tinubu and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Frank made the call in his reaction to the just concluded off-cycle governorship elections in three states of Kogi, Imo and Bayelsa. According to Frank in a statement in Abuja, the level of electoral fraud, manipulation and rigging witnessed in Kogi and Imo states especially, points to the fact that no credible result can come out from future exercises. “The election has nothing to write home about and to imagine that it was the first set of elections conducted under the watch of President Tinubu. What happened in Imo and Kogi is a clear indication of the kind of elections Nigerians will witness in 2027. “Our electoral system is presently in dire straits under our highly compromised Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which has now graduated from rigging by manipulating the INEC Result View (IReV) portal and the Bi-Modal Voter Accreditation System (BIVAS) to writing results of polling units before the people cast their ballots,” he said. Frank who is the United Liberating Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, lamented that when INEC which is now a rigging department under APC has finished manipulating results, the judiciary which is unfortunately now the legal department of the ruling party, will simply legalise what the electoral body has done. Besides, security agencies that were meant to protect voters and arrest riggers also take part in the rigging. The police, and other security agencies are now a security department in the APC. He insisted that the brazen level of rigging in Imo and Kogi was not surprising because Tinubu himself was installed President through rigging and other acts of impunity which the judiciary validated. POLL Frank said: “It is sad that when our democracy in Nigeria is meant to be progressing, it is rather retrogressing. Nigeria is now the worst country in terms of compromised election results compared to other African countries. “We don’t make improvements, we don’t make progress. Things are getting worse. So in 2027, if Nigerians do not take the bull by the horns to fight to restore credibility in our electoral system we’ll continue to have elections where the will of the people will not count. This is even so when the APC has appointed 10 of their card carrying members as Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) of the INEC. “This anti-democratic and unfortunate development is a clear indication that the conduct of the 2027 elections will be a formality to endorse only APC candidates either as freshers or for second term in their various offices. “So if Nigerians want change, they should wake up and do the right thing, like other nations have done to defend their democracy.” According to him, now that all the institutions of government that are meant to defend democracy, have practically compromised, “if we are not careful, Nigeria will turn to a one party state.” He added: “It’s quite disappointing for a man, who under in the PDP regime was always crying, that the party wanted to turn Nigeria into a one party state, is unfortunately the one that is practically poised to officially turn Nigeria into a one party state like Uganda, Zimbabwe and Cameroon that have been under one party rule for decades.” He lamented that opposition governors have compromised their parties and have failed to perform their role as opposition because of harassment and blackmail. He added: “So the opposition governors, especially the PDP governors, have turned themselves into praise singers because they have been blackmailed them to jettison their role as leaders of opposition in the country. “That’s why some of us have decided to bear the pains by doing everything in our power to legally defend our democracy and our country from turning into a one party state. “We have commenced mobilising Nigerians especially in diaspora to save the country from the hands of election riggers and make sure our democracy stands. “If we don’t stop Tinubu and APC, they will turn Nigeria into a one party state like Cameroon, Zimbabwe and Uganda,” Frank added.",top,nigeria

11:30:25,Alexis Simendinger and Kristina Karisch,Morning Report — Democrats open to Speaker’s funding fallback,https://thehill.com/newsletters/morning-report/4308412-democrats-open-to-speakers-funding-fallback/,"Whew. A consensus goal on Capitol Hill to avert a lapse in federal funding this week appears increasingly possible. Clues on Monday suggested members in both parties and in both chambers are getting behind a temporary solution proposed by Speaker (R-La.) before a deadline Friday at midnight. House Minority Leader (D-N.Y.) to fund the government in tranches that would expire early next year. There would be no deep spending cuts or ideological riders sought by conservatives. With Democratic votes, Johnson could afford to let some of his GOP hardline colleagues vote “no” and still keep the government operating, likely without the dramatic mutiny that cost former Speaker (R-Calif.) the gavel just weeks ago. Senate Majority Leader (D-N.Y.) on Monday also signaled openness to the Johnson plan after a lukewarm reception from some senators and the White House on Sunday. He called it “far from perfect” but said the proposal could work ( ). Under the two-track temporary compromise, the House would extend funding for military construction, veterans’ benefits, transportation, housing, urban development, agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and energy and water programs through Jan. 19. Funding for all other federal operations, including defense, would expire on Feb. 2. are elements of ’s request to Congress for a total of $105 billion in supplemental funding to assist Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security.

DeSantis stands as Haley’s strongest competition for her party’s second-place slot, although the Florida governor’s campaign has shown signs of financial strain following a tumultuous summer ( ).

Trump’s defense team began presenting its case Monday, with co-defendant testifying in glowing terms about the company’s properties. Trump Jr. testified two weeks ago as James’s lawyers presented their case, distancing himself from the organization’s financial statements. On Monday, he was not asked about the financial statements and instead focused on touting various Trump locales. The remarks appeared aimed at bolstering the defense’s argument that the asset valuations on financial statements were not false but, instead, reflected the properties’ real values ( ). Trump’s legal team asked a federal judge to televise his election obstruction trial, echoing media outlets that argue the American public should be able to watch the case in real time.

10:12:26,Jasmine Allday,BBC EastEnders fans spot huge blunder after horror café fire,https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/bbc-eastenders-fans-spot-huge-31433364,"EastEnders fans have noticed a big mistake as the fate of the café fire victims was revealed. Rocky Cotton started a fire at Kathy's café by messing with the electrics, hoping to use the insurance money to pay off his gambling debts. But sadly, Bobby Beale ran into the café to try and save it from the flames but got caught in an explosion along with Peter Beale and Rocky, putting them all in danger. At the start of Monday night's episode, it was confirmed that Rocky is doing well and was able to leave the hospital while Ian and Cindy arrived to see a sickly Bobby. However, he managed to give Ian a hug while Cindy frantically looked for Peter. Peter was seen in intensive care, hooked up to machines including a ventilator, with the family understandably worried about whether he will survive after being caught in the terrible explosion. However, fans spotted a big mistake on the BBC soap and shared their thoughts on Reddit. One wrote: ""Bobby escaping with tiny knock on his head and Peter in a life threatening coma is absolute BS,"" while another added: ""In the real world, Bobby would be dead. No one is surviving that explosion."" A third shared: ""Even if they did, with that minimal of an injury is ridiculous."" A fourth fan commented: ""The way Bobby just jumped up today and was like ""Daaad"".. All chipper and ready to roll with a tiny chicken scratch on his head!? Come on!"" A final viewer added: ""Bobby had just tripped the switch then the window beside him shattered with flames coming out right where he was standing. How he got to the other side of the cafe is beyond me."" Brian Conley, who plays Rocky Cotton, will be leaving soon. But will his recent actions play a part in his exit? Speaking about his departure, Brian said: ""I made my decision for many reasons, this decision, and it's tough because they're such a wonderful crowd. In front of the cameras and behind the cameras, I've loved my three years there. ""There's other parts of the reports saying that I 'clashed' with TV bosses and the crew. I didn't 'clash' with anyone, I didn't have a rant. I've gone with their [ EastEnders '] blessings at the BBC, I'm excited about the future and where it's going to go.""",top,united kingdom

By 2003 he was named as the programme director - and the good times started to roll. Medals poured in as Olympic heroes Bradley Wiggins and Jason Kenny became household names. However, all was not well in the British Cycling camp, with Brailsford being accused of bullying and sexism. Though Brailsford hit back at these claims in his column in The Times. He said: ""Reading some of the more lurid headlines in recent weeks, you could be forgiven for thinking that our Olympic and Paralympic cycling success was forged in a boot camp for bullies and sexists rather than a high-performance environment that nurtured world-class athletes to fulfil their potential. “We were not sexist, we were medallist.

Team Sky revolutionised cycling, dragging the sport into the 21st century with their 'marginal gains'. ""The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improved it by 1%, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together,"" he explained. Brailsford had hoped to crown a British tour champion in ten years - he did it in two. During the 2012 edition of the event, Wiggins, flanked by Chris Froome, dismissed the challenge of Vincenzo Nibali as they broke the will of the Italian in the Alps and the Pyrenees. The era of dominance from Team Sky was born. Chris Froome won the Tour four times, while Geraint Thomas shocked the world in 2018 to claim his sole victory. Colombian Egan Bernal won the 2019 edition, becoming the first non-British rider to win the Tour on the team. Brailsford's world had drastically changed when Bernal became the youngest winner of the post-World War 2 era. He was now focusing solely on Team Sky, after stepping down from his role at British Cycling. Team Sky had also been renamed INEOS-Grenadiers, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe purchased the team ahead of the 2019 lap of France. However, Brailsford was now also embroiled in a doping scandal, centring on Wiggins. A suspect package was sent to Sky in 2011 to treat Wiggins, but the case was dismissed when UKAD couldn't find enough evidence to suggest what was in the package. ""There’s a rider, there’s a doctor. They agree to visit a consultant. The consultant’s report is pretty categorical in saying there is an issue here and I recommend the following medication,"" Brailsford said. “That then goes to the anti-doping authorities. They say yes, we agree with this. Or they can say no. There are different steps to this process that should give us confidence. I believe in that process. I still do.” However, in March 2018 the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published a report that concluded Team Sky had crossed an ""ethical"" line surrounding the use of triamcinolone in the build-up to the 2012 Tour. In 2021, Brailsford was appointed as Director of Sport for INEOS, and his appearances at cycling races started to dwindle with his new role. And he admitted after battling health scares he might not be able to fulfil his role: “If I do have any further health issues, I won’t be able to continue. “I’m pretty clear about that."" As INEOS' stranglehold on the cycling world has started to dwindle thanks to the emergence of Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard, Brailsford has been at the centre of INEOS' project with Nice. The 59-year-old was so dedicated to the role, he slept in a camper van at the training ground. This season, with the INEOS millions, Nice are the only unbeaten side in Ligue 1 and currently sit in second place. Is Brailsford the man to get the Stretford End singing again? Sir Jim will certainly be hoping so.",sports,united kingdom
11:43:38,Rohini  Hensman,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

11:00:00,Niall Stanage,4 alternative presidential candidates — and how they might impact the 2024 race,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4307641-four-alternative-presidential-candidates-and-how-they-might-impact-the-2024-race/,"The 2024 presidential election field could be unusually crowded. Right now, President Biden and former President Trump look likely to face off in a rematch of the 2020 election. But there are at least three well-known names also in the mix: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein. They could be joined by a fourth, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who sounded inclined to launch a third-party White House bid when he announced last week that he would not run for reelection to the upper chamber next year. Here is a look at the four declared or possible candidates, and how they could change the race Kennedy is the candidate whose impact on the race may be the greatest — and the hardest to gauge in terms of its specific effect. He began the 2024 cycle competing against Biden in the Democratic primary and got off to a strong start — buoyed, presumably, in part by having such a revered last name. But he plateaued in the polls and, on Oct. 9, launched an independent bid. Recent polls have suggested that, in a three-way race with Biden, Trump and Kennedy, the scion of the famous family might take more voters from the Republican than from the Democrat. released Nov. 1 found Biden with only a 1 point lead over Trump in a straight head-to-head race but with a 3 point edge when Kennedy was included. Fourteen percent of Republicans were inclined to vote for Kennedy in that scenario, compared with 12 percent of Democrats. During the period when Kennedy was still officially a Democratic candidate, data and polling site that he consistently scored higher favorability ratings among Republican voters than among their Democratic counterparts. It’s not that hard to discern why this might be happening. Kennedy’s deep skepticism of vaccines and his propensity to at least nod toward conspiracy theories are a fairly snug fit with Trump’s rhetoric and worldview. Like the former president, Kennedy often leans toward the idea that shadowy elites are conspiring against the interests of regular folks. Similarly, Kennedy’s view of the war in Ukraine — essentially, that the West adopted an excessively belligerent stance toward Russia, including through the expansion of NATO — has more in common with Trump than Biden. Kennedy’s shift from Democratic insurgent to independent candidate has also wrought a noticeable change in media coverage from some conservative media. Sean Hannity, who at one point had praised Kennedy for his supposed support of “medical freedom,” during a later appearance pressed Kennedy aggressively on what the host termed “as pretty liberal of a record as anybody I know.” West is the closest thing the race has to offer to an orthodox hard-left candidate. His renown as an academic and activist — and his charisma — make him particularly dangerous for Biden. So too does his putative ability to appeal to the Black community, whose votes Biden desperately needs. West served as a surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders’s. (I-Vt.) campaign in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, so it’s no surprise he shares much of the democratic socialist’s worldview. West’s candidacy is built around the ideas that America is far too unequal, that not enough is done to improve the plight of the poor and that both major parties are far too beholden to the interests of corporations and wealthy individuals. As the Israel-Hamas conflict has raged, West has been to the fore in expressing indignation and sympathy over the suffering being visited upon the Palestinians. West faces one very considerable challenge: ballot access. He initially sought the nomination of the Green Party but is now an outright independent. It is not clear how he will get on the ballot in enough states to make a difference. That will be a relief for Biden. The same Quinnipiac poll referenced above measured a four-way race between Biden, Trump, Kennedy and West. West drew 6 percent support, overwhelmingly from Democrats and independents. Stein was something of a surprise entrant into the 2024 field, popping up last Thursday. Stein was the Green Party’s presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, and she is seeking the same position again. “The political system is broken. The two Wall Street parties are bought and paid for,” she said in a video announcing her candidacy. “Over 60 percent of us now say the bipartisan establishment’s failed us and we need a party that serves the people.” There are significant doubts as to whether Stein will be a major factor this time around, in part because both Kennedy and West could be expected to cut into the Green Party’s already modest base of support. The scars from 2016 are also relevant. Even though Stein only received roughly 1 percent of the vote nationwide, the election was ultimately decided for Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by tiny margins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. In every one of the three, the number of votes cast for Stein was greater than Trump’s margin of victory. It’s important not to oversimplify the cause and effect in 2016. Had Stein not run, it’s not as if every single one of her voters would have transferred their allegiance to Clinton. Complicating the picture further, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, whose voters would overall be considered to lean right, outpolled Stein in all three states. Even so, Stein was a target of the wrath of disappointed Democrats in the aftermath. Four years later, Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins received only about one-third of 1 percent of the votes cast. Left-leaning voters might well balk again at supporting Stein in 2024, especially if Trump is on the ballot. Manchin is the only one of the four alternative candidates who has yet to make his bid official. But during last week’s remarks giving notice of his Senate retirement, Manchin said that he would be “traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.” The notion of mobilizing the middle dovetails perfectly with the No Labels group, with which Manchin has been in an extended flirtation. The group draws a lot of criticism from Democrats, who accuse it of being engaged in something akin to a false flag operation to aid Republicans. No Labels has already secured a spot on the ballot in roughly a dozen states, but the group is not expected to decide whether to run a candidate until March or April 2024. No Labels highlights polling that emphasizes Americans’ dissatisfaction with the choices currently available. But that is very different from saying that there is a groundswell of support for Manchin. He is widely disliked among Democrats, and it’s not at all clear why Republican voters or right-leaning independents would vote for a longtime Democratic senator.",top,united states of america

To continue reading, please subscribe: * Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming for months across America — to audiences large and small, from churches and colleges to spiritual centers and soup kitchens — in a demanding schedule of appearances in her second tenacious, against-the-odds run for the presidency. The bestselling spiritual author and one-time advisor to Oprah Winfrey didn’t make it to the 2020 primaries in a wide-open Democratic field. Now she is running against a sitting president from her own party, and the Democratic establishment has closed ranks behind Joe Biden. Even some of her most devoted followers doubt she can be elected. So why is Williamson even running? She says it’s the faith she has in herself and the American people. “The most important things you do in life, not because there’s guaranteed success on some external level, but because you feel in your heart it’s the right thing to do,” Williamson, 71, said during an interview in New York City. She admits it has been grueling at times — not just the punishing campaign schedule, but more so the emotional bruising from a barrage of unflattering characterizations. For her, it’s “the ultimate challenge to have tough skin, but a soft and open heart,” she said. But Williamson worries that negative perceptions detract from her policy positions, which include financial reparations for Black Americans and creation of a Department of Peace. “What are the words they use? Wacky, kooky, crystal lady,” she said, listing the names she’s called. “People will take one line out of a book, completely out of context. That has certainly been done to me. Plus, you know, they lie.” Born in Houston to a Jewish family, Judaism remains her core belief, and she also embraces universal spiritual themes, like loving one another. Williamson came into the spotlight with her popular 1992 book, “A Return to Love.” Oprah, highlighting it on her own site, wrote: “I have never been more moved by a book.” Williamson, the author of more than a dozen titles and well-known for supporting LGBTQ people, retains a legion of dedicated fans. Millions buy her books, attend her lectures and engage with her on TikTok. “She is extremely sincere in her beliefs, wise in many ways even,” said Issac Bailey, a communications professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who has written about Williamson’s faith and politics. “But she also has a streak that takes her beyond the pale.” He pointed to her wariness and sharp criticism of government vaccine mandates that came up during her last campaign. She later said she supports vaccines. “I’m a socially middle of the road Jew who goes to the doctor,” she said. “I’m not a crystal lady. I understand how important science is.” Williamson entered politics with an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014, then broke onto the national stage two years later as a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders’ failed presidential bid. In 2020, she entered the race herself. She acknowledges making what she calls “cringeworthy” comments back then, like how she would harness love to defeat former President Donald Trump. “Once they could be contextualized in a way that made me appear silly, there was almost no getting past the mockery,” she said. People may embrace quasi-spiritual language in their private lives, but if it’s from political candidates, it typically doesn’t play well on the campaign trail, said Galen Watts, a sociology and legal studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But this is not new territory for Williamson. For years, she has been under fire from intellectuals who call her theology too shallow, from politicians who mock her ideas, and more recently from some former campaign staff who say she’s irascible and is only trying to sell more books. She concedes that she probably swore more than she should have in her last campaign, but scoffs at the book-selling gibe. “The way to sell books is by going on a book tour, not a presidential campaign,” she said. “The way to sell books in my field is to never mention politics.” Some have questioned her political inexperience. But she dismisses that: “I reject the notion that only those whose careers have been ensconced in the car that drove us into this ditch are the only people we should consider qualified to drive us out of the ditch.” She announced her candidacy in February, and now is arguably the best-known Democrat still challenging Biden for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. But recent polls show her running more than 60 percentage points behind. She is well-liked by many young people, including Jose Serna, a 21-year-old at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Serna hopes she stays in the race “because she is illuminating the ideas that young people care about” including Medicare for all, equitable wages and affordable housing. “While I do believe that it is unlikely that Marianne will win the nomination, it is not because of her policies,” he said, citing a common complaint by Williamson and her backers about a lack of media attention. Marie Griffith, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, says there’s a practical reason why Williamson stands no chance of winning. “She has no connection that I know of to Democratic machine politics — meaning the people who raise all the money and make or break the political careers of those identifying as Democrats,” Griffith said. Williamson talks at times in religious and spiritual terms to describe America as a nation in need of confession and atonement. She worries about vast economic inequality and wants to declare a climate emergency. One of her signature policy proposals would have the government pay Black citizens reparations for centuries of enslavement and discrimination. She advocated for this in her 1997 book “The Healing of America.” Today, she proposes creating a council of Black academic, cultural and political leaders to disperse at least $1 trillion to Black Americans over two decades. Author and rabbi Jay Michaelson lauded Williamson for raising the issue before other political candidates, and for her work during the AIDS crisis, but in 2019 he wrote a scathing critique of her bid for president. He called her “selfish, deluded and dumb by denigrating science” and said she gives spiritually a bad name. Michaelson, in a recent interview, said he agreed with Williamson “that our spiritual commitments and our religious commitments should impact our political lives.” But he says she will remain a fringe candidate because some of her policy positions are too radical for many. “To say, ‘We need a politics of love’ without explaining what that is,” he said. “Or that we need a new paradigm, or that we need some kind of revolution — that doesn’t play on Main Street.” Wednesdays A weekly look towards a post-pandemic future. Williamson denies denigrating science and disputes broader criticisms of her campaign. “This idea that I am unserious — my campaign is the one talking about one in four Americans living with medical debt. My campaign is the one talking about the fact that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “My campaign is the most serious campaign.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

13:00:49,By Bruce Fuller,Opinion: Chinese students wonder if Biden can engage Xi with curiosity,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/14/opinion-chinese-students-wonder-if-biden-can-engage-xi-with-curiosity/,"Hopes and fears have soared in the run-up to President Biden’s sit down with China’s leader, Xi Jinpeng, set for Wednesday in San Francisco. Not since the Vietnam War has America’s diplomatic dance with the People’s Republic fractured so many toes. One ray of hope shines bright — the more than 300,000 Chinese students who attend American universities, signaling the generosity of both governments. These young scholars enliven my classroom and enrich research programs around the country. Many come away with warm affection for America: our free press and raucous debates, our music and movies, even calling professors by their first name. Still, the backdrop to the Biden-Xi summit remains ominous. In recent months, the U.S. has shot down China’s spy balloon floating across the Midwest, limited technologies exported to Beijing, and implored Xi to push his ally, Iran, to defuse the bloody Israeli-Hamas conflict. Protestors will greet Xi on his arrival to California, spotlighting his oppression of writers and religion. But the wide panorama of Chinese students in the America — acquainted with both societies — offers fresh lessons. I asked several across the nation hosted by colleagues what hopes these young scholars hold for this week’s Bay Area gathering. Here’s what I heard: • Yi. Biden should express “deep respect for (Xi’s) family heritage, his father a notable figure in Chinese history (a military hero, then distributed land to rural peasants). He is quite stubborn and firmly believes in his convictions.” Biden should be “eager to advance cooperation with China openly and sincerely (in) the economy, education and health care.” • Zhang. “Opening markets would be a good thing, the return of Google. When my mother had chemotherapy, the better medicine from the U.S., with fewer side effects, was no longer available.” • Hui. “Xi emphasizes our confidence in traditional (Confucian) culture, that is, how we view the modernization process with Chinese characteristics. Traditional wisdom emphasizes harmony and development. These are common values (shared by both nations).” • Li. “The narrative in China is that America is a big bully, intervening into others’ domestic affairs. Maybe nudges are seen as condescending. I very much hope they can build trust.” • Zixi. “China should avoid misrepresenting or vilifying the U.S. in global discourse. I desire greater collaboration and mutual respect, particularly among younger generations.” America “should invite more Chinese students, perhaps with a tuition discount.” Overall, the students with whom I spoke revealed a certain savvy, expressing realpolitik over material rivalries. But they also hunger for mutual respect, for Americans to learn about their history and age-old cultural values, such as nurturing harmony and discounting oneself to cooperatively build civil society. Washington remains obsessed with stratospheric interests, such as selling semiconductors to China, cultivating allies that surround the People’s Republic. White House advisors briefed reporters last week, objectifying the Chinese people, dryly suggesting that Biden seeks to “manage the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict.” Instead, these students invite Americans to rise above cultural caricature and grim narratives of geopolitical combat. They yearn to know us better and for us to reach out to them.",top,united states of america
10:53:28,Michael Moran,Fighter jet pictured shooting down UFO after Marine exposes ET 'black site',https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/fighter-jet-pictured-shooting-down-31432135,"A US Marine claims to have visited a secret military facility that's purpose is to ""shoot down"" extraterrestrial craft – with a new photo since emerging of such an event. Michael Herrera testified under oath in front of the US Congress that he had stumbled across a 300-foot in the jungles of Indonesia. It was constantly changing colour from light grey to black “like someone was operating a dimmer switch” but was warned off by armed special forces personnel. Now, in a sensational new interview, he claims to have visited a secret government ”black site” that uses advanced weapons to “take down” extraterrestrial craft. As Herrera’s claims emerge, The has released an image of what was at the time described as a “hostile drone” shot down over Syria by an RAF Typhoon. The object – described in RAF reports as an “unidentified aerial phenomenon” [UAP] appeared to be a saucer or mushroom-shaped object. The MoD said the ""terrorist drone"" – which was destroyed on December 14 2021 - ""posed a threat"" to coalition forces fighting the Islamic State group in southern Syria. Jeremy Corbell from Weaponized told the Daily Star he had ""no idea"" if the Ministry of Defence would officially release this image. Michael Herrera made his claims in an interview with – the USAF fighter pilot turned podcaster with a special interest in the recent UAP revelations. He said in July this year that someone within the US military had reached out to him and asked if he wanted to go on a helicopter ride. “We end up going to a black site, which looks abandoned top side,” Michael said. “There’s no activity visible… genius on their part. But underneath the surface is a very different story. “It's a very active spot. They do a lot of scalar longitudinal weapon testing or EMPs this is a very advanced version but they have different types. “They have some that are so surgical that are very accurate then they have some that are kind of like a wave. The purpose of that facility is to actually take down ET craft and they do this about two to three times a year…” Herrera was very cautious not to name his source and avoided even mentioning the name of the unit he was working for. The only thing he did reveal is that he’d met this contact while providing security for controversial expert Dr Steven Greer. The US government has been doing “UFO crash retrievals since the 1940s”, he claimed. But he added that there were powerful business interests preventing the truth about UFOs from becoming public, because it would completely transform our way of life. He says that the US government has ET technology that could “change the world”. “There’s a lot of breakthroughs that could happen … that's not just transportation wise but we're talking about medical we're talking about the economy we're talking about technology with power – poverty would basically end overnight.”",top,united kingdom
13:07:49,,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Smoke rises as displaced Palestinians take shelter at Al Shifa hospital, amid the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel, in Gaza City on November 8.(Reuters) At least 13 people were killed when Israeli forces targeted their homes in the southern city of Khan Younis, Gaza health ministry officials said. The military has also positioned tanks outside Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza City's main medical centre, which Israel says sits atop tunnels housing a headquarters for Hamas fighters who are using patients as shields.

The Israeli military said it was coordinating the transfer of incubators into Gaza, in a possible measure to enable the evacuation of newborn babies from the hospital. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra, who was inside Al Shifa hospital, said on Monday 32 patients had died in the previous three days, including three newborns. At least 650 patients remain inside, he added. In his first comments since the patient deaths reported at Al Shifa, US President Joe Biden said hospitals must be protected. ""My hope and expectation is that there will be less intrusive action relative to hospitals and we remain in contact with the Israelis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday. ""Also there is an effort to get this pause to deal with the release of prisoners and that's being negotiated, as well, with the Qataris ... being engaged,"" he added. ""So I remain somewhat hopeful but hospitals must be protected."" On Monday, Israel's military released video and photos of what it said were weapons the group stored in the basement of Rantissi hospital, a paediatric hospital specializing in cancer treatment. In a statement on its Telegram channel, Hamas said the video showed ""fabricated scenes that misled public opinion"", adding that it was a ""failed attempt"" by Israel to justify the targeting of hospitals. Hostages for ceasefire? Israel launched its war against Hamas after the Islamist Palestinian group's Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israel. Around 1,200 people died in that attack and 240 were dragged to Gaza as hostages according to Israel's tally. The armed wing of Hamas said it was ready to free up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for a five-day truce in the war. Gaza medical authorities say more than 11,000 people have been confirmed killed in Israeli bombardment, about 40% of them children. Israeli soldiers operate amid what the Israeli army says is the ongoing ground operation against the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in a location given as Gaza, in this screen grab from a handout video released on November 14, 2023. (Reuters) Roughly two-thirds of the people in the densely populated Mediterranean strip have been made homeless by Israel's military campaign, in which it has ordered the northern half of Gaza evacuated. Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, posted an audio recording on Telegram saying the group was ready to release as many as 70 women and children hostages in return for a five-day ceasefire, an offer Israel is unlikely to embrace. ""We told the (Qatari) mediators that in a five-day truce, we can release 50 of them and the number could reach 70 due to the difficulty that the captives are held by different factions,"" said al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Ubaida said, saying Israel had asked for 100 to be freed. Read | Is Hamas hiding in Gaza's main hospital? Israel's claim in focus in dayslong stalemate Israel, which effectively blockades Gaza, has rejected a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas would simply use it to regroup, but has permitted brief humanitarian ""pauses"" to allow food and other supplies to flow in and foreigners to flee. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Washington would ""like to see considerably longer pauses - days, not hours - in the context of a hostage release."" A Washington Post opinion writer on Tuesday quoted an unnamed high-ranking Israeli official as saying Israel and Hamas are close to a deal to free most of the kidnapped Israeli women and children with Israel simultaneously releasing Palestinian women and youths held in its prisons. An agreement could be announced within days if the details are worked out. West Bank violence In the occupied West Bank, at least six Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces, the Palestinian health ministry and Palestinian media said. At least three of those were killed in an Israeli drone strike, the Palestinians' official news agency WAFA reported, citing a hospital in the western city of Tulkarm. The Israeli army and police said their forces, sent into Tulkarm to detain suspected militants, came under fire and killed several Palestinian gunmen in the ensuing skirmish. Israeli troops also shot dead at least two Palestinians during earlier clashes in a refugee camp in the city, WAFA reported. The worsening violence in the West Bank comes after more than 18 months of bloodshed that has fuelled fears the West Bank could erupt into a bigger conflict and become a new front. ""Exciting news!

11:43:38,Rohini  Hensman,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism. A Jewish man with an anti-Zionist sign at a demonstration in New York City on October 26. | Photo Credit: Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS During the First World War, Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in harmony in Palestine and aspired to independence; a UN study noted that there was sympathy for Jews on the part of the rest of the Palestinian population and no racial rancour against them. But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be? Stars of David painted on a wall in Paris on October 31. French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

The 19-year-old actor has been at the center of controversy recently, drawing criticism for his social media activity and statements related to the conflict. The controversy began when Schnapp shared his concerns about the unrest in the region, expressing that he was 'scared' by the ongoing conflict. His initial statement received mixed reactions, with some supporting his expression of fear and others critical of his perspective. However, Schnapp's troubles began when he liked a video that mocked Muslim people and offended the queer community, further fueling the backlash against him. In a new video that has since gone viral, Schnapp was seen smiling while filming a group of friends displaying stickers with the phrases, ' Zionism is sexy' and ' Hamas is ISIS.' This video stirred significant outrage and left many alarmed and publicly calling him out for his actions. Zionism, the movement supporting the re-establishment and protection of a Jewish homeland in historic Israel, remains a deeply contentious issue. The ongoing conflict in Palestine , which began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel in October, has resulted in a tragic loss of life, with both sides suffering casualties. Rage on Twitter Twitter users took to the platform to express their disappointment and frustration. Some accused Schnapp of insensitivity and even condoning the oppression of Palestinians. Others criticized the stark contrast between the treatment of those who publicly support Palestine and the consequences they face, contrasting it with Schnapp's seemingly unchecked behavior. The ongoing conflict in the region has led to a rising death toll, with many calling for a ceasefire. The tensions have escalated, leading to extensive casualties and devastating loss of life on both sides. Several celebrities, including Gal Gadot and Amy Schumer, have used their platforms to voice their opinions on the situation, with some advocating for peace and expressing their concerns. However, Schnapp's response to the conflict has drawn significant scrutiny and backlash from many who feel that his actions and statements were ill-considered. As of now, Schnapp has not publicly addressed the controversy or the backlash he is facing. FAQs: What was Noah Schnapp's last project? Earlier this year, Noah Schnapp starred in the 2023 American psychological thriller film 'The Tutor' directed by Jordan Ross alongside Nickelodeon fame Victoria Justice. What is Hamas? Hamas, an acronym of its official name, the Islamic Resistance Movement, is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist political and military organization governing the Gaza Strip of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Another 200,000 people have fled northern Gaza since Nov. 5, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday, as Israeli ground forces battle Palestinian militants around hospitals where patients, newborns and medics are stranded with no electricity and dwindling supplies. The humanitarian office, known as OCHA, says only one hospital in the north is capable of receiving patients. All the others are no longer able to function and mostly serve as shelters from the fighting, including Gaza’s largest, Shifa, which is surrounded by Israeli troops and where 36 babies are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel, in which militants massacred hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. Israel launched heavy airstrikes for nearly three weeks before sending troops and tanks into the north. The war has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished coastal enclave. Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes from north to south, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. U.N.-run shelters in the south are severely overcrowded, with an average of one toilet for 160 people. In all, some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no fuel for water pumps or treatment plants. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it was unable to continue importing limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. With Israeli forces fighting Palestinian militants in the center of Gaza City, the territory’s main city, both sides have seized on the plight of hospitals. Images of doctors trying to keep newborns warm at Shifa have circulated widely. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters, alleging that Hamas has set up its main command center in and beneath Shifa, without providing visual evidence. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the Israeli allegations. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes the militants were holding hostages. “Hamas uses hospitals as an instrument of war,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the army’s chief spokesperson, standing in a room of the Rantisi Children’s Hospital decorated with a colorful children’s drawing of a tree. Explosive vests, grenades and RPGs were displayed on the floor. Meanwhile, gunfire and explosions raged Monday around Shifa, which Israeli troops encircled over the weekend. Tens of thousands of people have fled the hospital in the past few days and headed to the southern Gaza Strip, including large numbers of displaced people who had taken shelter there. For weeks, Shifa staff members running low on supplies have performed surgery on war-wounded patients, including children, without anesthesia and using vinegar as antiseptic. After the weekend’s mass exodus, about 650 patients and 500 staff remain in the hospital, which can no longer function, along with around 2,500 displaced Palestinians sheltering inside with little food or water. The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said 32 patients, including three babies, have died since its emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. It said 36 babies, as well as other patients, are at risk of dying because life-saving equipment cannot function. Early Tuesday, the Israeli military said in a statement that it had started an effort to transfer incubators from Israel to Shifa. It wasn’t clear if the incubators had been delivered or how they will be powered. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. The International Committee of the Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 patients, staff and displaced people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds. But the Red Cross said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. Israel released a video showing what it said was a militant with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher entering Al-Quds Hospital. An Israeli tank was stationed nearby. The U.S. has pushed for temporary pauses to allow wider distribution of badly needed aid. Israel has agreed only to daily windows during which civilians can flee northern Gaza on foot along two main roads. As of last Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. Health officials have not updated the toll, citing the difficulty of collecting information. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. Palestinian militants. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire since the start of the war. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

While the students were not at the football game as part of a school-sponsored event, Sponheim said the district is cooperating fully with Pasadena Police investigation. “As this is still an ongoing investigation, we cannot confirm anything other than that the individuals in question were not on an official visit,” UCLA Athletics said in a statement.

In Uttar Pradesh's 403-member assembly, the Congress's strength has been reduced to only three while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won only one seat last time, Adityanath said. ""The people must have experienced and understood the (nature of) the Congress and other parties,"" he said.

In the video shared to Instagram on Sunday, the Will Byers actor , 19, who is Jewish, is seen laughing as he sits among friends who show off the stickers - which also read 'Hamas is Isis .' Last month, Schnapp - who has openly supported Israel and condemned Hamas terrorists faced backlash for posting a statement on Instagram in the wake of Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel - which killed more than 1300 people and saw 240 people taken hostage. His statement read: 'You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism. It shouldn't be a difficult choice. Shame on you' - which was seen as condoning Israel's siege of Gaza. In the wake of the video, fans took to social media to brand the star 'sick and twisted' and urge viewers to boycott the new season of Stranger Things. Backlash: Stranger Things star Noah Schnapp has been slammed for showing off 'Zionism is sexy' stickers amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war Video: In the video shared to Instagram on Sunday, the Will Byers actor, 19, who is Jewish, is seen laughing as he sits among friends who show off the stickers - which also read 'Hamas is Isis One fan wrote: 'Damn killing innocent civilians is sexy.

'Well get out of your cushy LA pad, give up your career and go live in Israel then if you love Palestinian genocide sooo badly.' DailyMail.com has contacted Schnapp's representatives for comment. In an October 11 post Schnapp wrote: 'As a Jewish American, I am afraid. Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel, who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas. I am truly heartbroken to see the brutal murders of innocent children, women and soldiers fighting to defend themselves. 'I, like others, want peace for both Palestinians and Israelis. Let's stop the rhetoric and choosing sides. Instead we must recognize that we are all on the side of the fight against terrorism. Choose humanity over violence. In the wake of the video, fans took to social media to brand the star 'sick and twisted' and urge viewers to boycott the new season of Stranger Things. 'I just reposted a beautiful picture of a young innocent girl whose life was taken by Hamas at a music festival. I was met with comments reading 'no one cares free Palestine' and 'She deserves that, and every Israeli terrorist deserves that – Free Palestine.' 'I am outraged by the justification and celebration of the death of a young girls life. Have people lost their minds??? STOP!' 'This is one example of many posts, rallies, and petitions being signed attempting to justify the brutality against these innocent Israeli people,' he continued. 'You don't have to be Jewish, you don't have to be Israeli, you just have to have empathy and common sense to know that THIS is wrong.' 'I hope we can agree that Hamas are a recognized terrorist organization: they don't represent the Palestinian people when they value murdering Israelis more than protecting their own. 'You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism. It shouldn't be a difficult choice. Shame on you.'

The death toll in Gaza since Hamas launched its wave of terror attacks on Israel on October 7 has exceeded 11,000 people, including over 4,500 children - the equivalent of one every 10 minutes, according to the World Health Organisation . Following Hamas' deadly October 7 attack on Israel, the nation's allies have defended the country's right to protect itself. But now into the second month of war, there are growing differences over how Israel should conduct its fight. The US has been pushing for temporary pauses that would allow for wider distribution of badly needed aid to civilians in the besieged territory where conditions are increasingly dire. However, Israel has only agreed to brief daily periods during which civilians can flee the area of ground combat in northern Gaza and head south on foot along the territory's main north-south artery. Since these evacuation windows were first announced a week ago, more than 150,000 civilians have fled the north, according to UN monitors. Palestinian civilians and rights advocates have pushed back against Israel's portrayal of the southern evacuation zones as 'relatively safe'. People mourn as they collect the bodies of Palestinians killed in Israeli raids on November 11, 2023 in Khan Yunis, Gaza They note that Israeli bombardment has continued across Gaza, including airstrikes in the south that Israel says target Hamas leaders but that have also killed women and children. More than 11,070 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and terrorist deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing and are thought to be possibly trapped or dead under the rubble. At least 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mainly in the initial Hamas attack, Israeli officials say.

He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

08:00:07,By Voice of the People | voicers@nydailynews.com | New York Daily News,"Readers sound off on keeping dogs outside, protesting Israel and the Trump children’s testimony",https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/11/14/readers-sound-off-on-keeping-dogs-outside-protesting-israel-and-the-trump-childrens-testimony/,"Brooklyn: Last week, the “Mutts” comic strip featured a well-known character named Guard Dog who is chained outdoors, depressed and dreams about running free. By Friday, I broke down and am still crying as I write this. Years ago, our family lived in a small upstate town next to a neighbor who owned a collie. It was routine for the winters there to dip below zero degrees overnight and stay in the single digits during the day. The collie, Laddie, was tied outside beside a meager doghouse that did little to nothing to keep him warm. We used to see Laddie shivering in the snow with icicles clinging to his coat. My mom was indignant and spoke a few words to the man who owned Laddie: “It’s too cold, you should take Laddie inside the house.” The man, a corrections officer, replied: “I have to stand outside all day in the freezing cold. If it’s good enough for me, it’s good enough for my dog.” Guard Dog has been instrumental in encouraging state laws restricting tethering nationwide. Other states have them. Astonishingly, New York has had Bill A5854A shuttling back and forth for years in the Assembly, being amended and returned, re-amended and re-returned and so forth. It’s currently in committee. This bill would restrict how long a dog can be tied without shelter, protect sick and injured animals, assure proper shelter including room to move around and fine anyone in violation. It’s a shame that such laws are necessary. It’s a greater shame that the wheels of justice have evidently frozen like Laddie, with icicles hanging from their spokes. Brooklyn: For the past several weeks, my Sunday paper has been delivered without the comics section, leaving my inner child deeply disappointed. Ever since I was a little kid, reading the Sunday funnies has been a ritual (although now that I’m grown, I do read the actual newspaper afterward). Yes, I’m aware that I can read them online as part of my subscription, but some of us readers are loyal to the print edition and relish the experience of reading the physical paper — and The News should be supporting the folks who support its print edition and who do not want to see the demise of print publishing. Toward that end, please enlarge the Saturday back-page crossword! I end up with such a headache. Morristown, N.J.: Most people would not consider John Rote to be a “vigilante,” as . He is actually a hero, unless you’re a bleeding-heart, gutless liberal. Glad to hear that the victim is fine, but she took the low road in knocking the very person who came to her aid. If there is a next time, there may be no one there to help. Then she’d be praying for a John Rote to appear. Coward Matthew Roesch, spineless enough to harass this woman, should have caught a bullet in the derrière. It might make him think twice about being a lowlife thug. Providence, R.I.: Re “ ” (Nov. 12), which says that Benjamin Netanyahu “insisted that after the war, now entering its sixth week, Gaza would be demilitarized and Israel would retain security control there”: Retaining Israel’s harsh control / for Gaza, means a mortal toll / but Bibi vows to stay the course / and neither side displays remorse. West Hempstead, L.I.: To Voicer Richie Nagan: Of course they did. There is no difference between Hamas and Fatah. Both support “from the river to the sea.” Both support death to Jews. Both say no Jews can live there at all. Both pay terrorists to kill Jews. So Israel wanted to weaken Fatah, not replace it. In 1979, the U.S. supported the return of the ayatollah to Iran. In the 1980s, we supported the mujahedeen against Russia and look where we are now. Not all decisions are wise or work out as planned. It does not excuse Hamas’ barbarity, nor does it lessen the justice and validity of Israel’s quest to destroy Hamas. Penticton, British Columbia: Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas has unleashed Operation Overkill — a genocidal war on thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians, particularly children. The inhumane suffering and complete destruction of Gaza by incessant Israeli bombing will go down in infamy alongside the Jewish Holocaust as the Palestinian Genocide. The Gaza demolition is creating worldwide protests that risk becoming violent, resulting in social unrest, destabilizing nations. Combined with Putin’s Ukraine invasion, climate change and ensuing hunger, this makes world peace a daunting challenge. Bronx: Your apologist editorial on the role of the teachers union and other official organizations in organizing student walkouts in support of Palestine (“ ,” Nov. 11) did hit one solid note: the need to teach. Do we teach our children about the American hostages held in Iran for 444 days? Who Leon Klinghoffer was and why he was murdered? Are the 220 Marines murdered in Beirut ever discussed, or the 9/11 attacks on our nation? Do we explain to our children that these events were all linked by being carried out by Islamic extremists? That the same ideology was behind the Oct. 7 massacre of Jews in Israel, one that included dozens of our fellow Americans? Probably not, because either the teachers were not taught these things or they have embraced the woke ideologies that defame democracy, disdain civil discourse and denounce freedom in the name of universal victimhood. Brooklyn: There seems to be a widespread pattern of people being denied job opportunities or being terminated from their employment because they showed just an ounce of sympathy for the Palestinian people and were highly critical of the Israeli government. How many people have been denied job opportunities or were terminated for denouncing Hamas and the Palestinian Authority and showing an enormous amount of support for the state of Israel? Just asking. Bellerose Village, L.I.: Anyone ever wonder what’s going to happen when artificial intelligence takes control of a self-driving car and drives it into an innocent crowd of people? Brooklyn: It is clear that the current Republicans are the real enemies of the American people. They refuse to accept any election returns that go against them, whether it is their refusal to accept the reality that President Biden won the 2020 election or trying to force abortion restrictions on their voters. They lose every challenge, yet they are still trying to overturn the will of the people. They are also trying to defund the government and deny government workers their salaries. The Republicans are acting more like spoiled children than responsible legislators. Kew Gardens: Interestingly, all three of Donald Trump’s children testified that they had no knowledge, skills or job responsibilities related to the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial reports. Their testimonies leave two people responsible: their father or the accountant. There is always a fall guy or buffer between Trump and punishment, which is a typical pattern for those who do business with this man. His concern is for himself only, a trait that the American people should be wary of. Old Bridge, N.J.: If Fred Trump hadn’t had money, Orangino would still be in grammar school. Staten Island: After their last month’s 16-31 loss to the Miami Dolphins, the New York Giants should have their name changed to the “N.Y. Lilliputians” — ouch! How’s that for “pun-ishment”? Jamaica: To Voicer John Pasquali: I totally agree with your assessment of the state of the Yankees management, and I’m totally glad to see another person recognize the Jordan Montgomery blunder. I can see a great Bill Gallo sketch for this Yankee season: Hero and GOAT. World Series champion: Jordan Montgomery. GOAT: Brian Cashman.",top,united states of america

08:30:43,Andrew Wilks,Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/gaza-war-pushes-tumultuous-israel-turkey-ties-into-deep-freezer?traffic_source=rss,"The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly of Israel. Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel’s onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments. “Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,” the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the , a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The vessel was trying to break Israel’s blockade and deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. It was the culmination of a sharp dive in ties since October 7. On October 20, Erdogan said Israel’s operations amounted to “genocide”. At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a “war criminal” over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas’s cross-border assault three weeks earlier. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital. But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints. By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. State-owned Turkish Airlines started direct flights to Israel in 1986. In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time. From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. Two defence agreements were signed in 1996, paving the way for a strategic military partnership that included the upgrading of F-4 and F-5 jet aircraft, M-60 tanks and helicopters. Turkey, Israel and the US participated in joint aerial and naval exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean until 2009. Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in 2002. Erdogan visited Tel Aviv as prime minister three years later, presenting himself as a possible mediator between Israelis and Palestinians. In 2004, Erdogan condemned Israel’s assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as “state-sponsored terrorism”, reflecting wider Turkish support for Palestinians, and Hamas in particular. Yet, during high-level visits in 2006 and 2007, Turkey worked to resolve tensions between Syria and Israel over Syria’s involvement in Lebanon and support for Palestinian groups and Hezbollah. In 2007, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul offered to help secure the release of three captured soldiers: Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas from 2006 to 2011, and Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev who were both held by Hezbollah from 2006 until their bodies were returned to Israel in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres at the time thanked Turkey, as well as Egypt and Germany, for helping release Shalit. The three-week war on Gaza in 2008-2009 reinforced tensions between Turkey and Israel. The assault on the Turkish aid ship Mavi Marmara led to a diplomatic falling-out, which saw Ankara expel the Israeli ambassador. Official ties remained frosty until 2016 when the two countries agreed to a compensation deal and a pathway to normalising relations. But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite rekindled diplomatic tensions, business between Turkey and Israel continued to boom. Between 2010, the year of the Mavi Marmara incident, and 2021, trade volume more than doubled from $3.4bn to $8.4bn. Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last year, Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara and ambassadors were appointed in both capitals. Erdogan met Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in September and they both pledged greater cooperation between their countries. The horrors of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Erdogan’s hardening rhetoric, however, appear to have stalled those plans. Last month, he cancelled any . Early in the current war, Erdogan spoke to multiple world leaders and between Hamas and Israel. That suggestion, said Piccoli of Teneo, appeared to have evaporated in recent days.",top,united states of america

Lubna Nazir Shaboo and her daughter Karima, crossed the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Monday evening. “They are in al-Arish (a city in Egypt). Tomorrow morning (Tuesday) they will move to Cairo,” Lubna’s husband Nedal Toman said in a text message sent to PTI from Gaza. The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region — in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo — for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. “We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,” she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their “water supply was officially cut off” in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn’t seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.",top,india

08:37:21,Rachael Bunyan,"Israel-Hamas LIVE: Gaza's largest hospital is turning into a 'cemetery', WHO warns, as President Biden says medical centres 'must be protected' amid heavy fighting between IDF and Hamas terrorists",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12746695/israel-hamas-war-live-palestine-updates-gaza-hospital-death.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"LIVE Israel-Hamas LIVE: Gaza's largest hospital is turning into a 'cemetery', WHO warns, as President Biden says medical centres 'must be protected' amid heavy fighting between IDF and Hamas terrorists By Rachael Bunyan Published: 08:23 GMT, 14 November 2023 | Updated: 09:16 GMT, 14 November 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Advertisement 09:16 Brazil's presidents sparks row with country's Jewish community with remarks on conflict Brazil's president sparked a row on Monday by accusing Israel of 'killing innocent people without any criteria' in the Gaza Strip, deeming its actions there 'as grave' as the October 7 attacks by the Hamas terror group. 'After the act of terrorism provoked by Hamas, the consequences, the solution of the state of Israel, is as grave as that of Hamas,' said Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at a ceremony in Brasilia welcoming Brazilians who had been evacuated from Gaza. 'They are killing innocent people without any criteria,' said Lula. He also accused Israel of 'dropping bombs where there are children, hospitals, on the pretext that a terrorist is there.' 'They are not killing soldiers, they are killing children,' he told journalists at the Brasilia Air Base, claiming the number of women and children killed or missing was unheard of. Lula, 78, who hugged and kissed the returnees on the tarmac, said he had 'never' seen 'such brutal and inhuman violence against innocent people'. 'This is inexplicable. First you have to save the women and children, then you fight with whomever you want,' Lula said. But representatives of Brazil's Jewish community denounced his remarks as 'erroneous', 'unfair' and 'dangerous'. They said the comments 'put Israel and Hamas on the same level', and defended the 'visible and proven' efforts of the Israeli authorities 'to save Palestinian civilians'. 'Our community expects balance from our authorities,' added the Israeli Confederation of Brazil, which claims to represent some 120,000 Brazilian Jews, the second largest community in the region, in a statement. 09:12 Al Shifa hospital director says 179 people have been buried in a 'mass grave' The director of Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital has said 179 people, including babies and patients who died in the medical centre's intensive care unit, have been buried in a 'mass grave' at the complex. 'We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,' said director Mohammad Abu Salmiyah, adding that seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those buried after hospital fuel supplies ran out. 'There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,' he said, as no fuel has entered the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. On Tuesday, a man and a woman died in the ICU bringing the number of people who had died in the unit to 29, Salmiyah said. A journalist inside the hospital who is collaborating with AFP news agency said the stench of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the facility. 09:06 The youngest victims of the Gaza war: Time is running out for 36 newborns at Shifa hospital surrounded by IDF Time is running out for 36 newborn babies at Gaza's biggest hospital. Israeli tanks have taken up positions outside Al Shifa Hospital, which Israel says sits atop tunnels housing a headquarters for Hamas who are using patients as shields. US President Joe Biden said hospitals in the Gaza Strip must be protected and he hoped for 'less intrusive' action by Israel as tanks advanced on the main gates, while Britain's Rishi Sunak said 'too many civilians' are dying in the coastal strip. Click the link below to read the full story: Time is running out for 36 babies at Shifa hospital surrounded by IDF Israeli tanks have taken up positions outside Al Shifa Hospital, which Israel says sits atop tunnels housing a headquarters for Hamas who are using patients as shields. Mail Online 08:30 Rishi Sunak says 'too many civilians' are dying in Gaza Last night, Rishi Sunak said ‘too many civilians’ are dying in Gaza and that there needs to be ‘unhindered humanitarian access and urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses’. The PM told the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London: ‘There are things that Israel must do as part of this response. ‘We’ve been clear that they must act within international law, they must take all measures to protect innocent civilians, including at hospitals, stop extremist violence in the West Bank and allow more aid into Gaza... too many civilians are losing their lives. ‘That’s why I’ve doubled our aid to Gaza and why we continue to press both at the United Nations and directly with Israel for unhindered humanitarian access and urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses. ‘We want aid coming in by air, land and sea, and we’re ready to use our bases in Cyprus as a staging post.’ 08:28 US President Biden says hospitals 'must be protected' amid heavy fighting Israeli tanks were massed near the gates of Gaza's main hospital where Palestinians were trapped in dire conditions on Tuesday as US President Joe Biden pressed Israel to protect the complex. After days of heavy air strikes around Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, witnesses said tanks and armoured vehicles were metres from the besieged facility, which has become a focal point of the five-week-old war. Israel accuses Hamas fighters of using tunnels under the hospital as a command 'node', effectively engaging the sick and injured as human shields. It is a charge that Hamas denies. Biden called on Israel to use 'less intrusive action relative to the hospital', some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date. 'The hospital must be protected,' he told reporters. Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner insisted Al-Shifa was 'central in Hamas's command and control capabilities', but said troops were currently 'stand-offish'. 'The idea is to try to evacuate the people, evacuate as many as possible,' he said. 08:21 Gaza's largest hospital is turning into a 'cemetery', WHO warns The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said Gaza's largest hospital is turning into a 'cemetery' where dead bodies are lying on the ground. After days of heavy air strikes around Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, witnesses said tanks and armoured vehicles were metres (yards) from the besieged facility, which has become a focal point of the five-week-old war. 'Around the hospital there are dead bodies which cannot be taken care of or not even be buried or taken away to any sort of morgue,' WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. 'The hospital is not working at all any more as it should. It's nearly a cemetery,' Lindemeier added. TOP STORIES My husband demanded a divorce just SIX MONTHS after our wedding!

11:43:38,Rohini  Hensman,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism.

But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

Earlier this month, the 19-year-old was met with a wave of fury when he liked a vile video that mocked Muslim people , while also offending the queer community. In a new video, he could be seen smiling while filming a group of friends, as they showed off labels which read, ‘Zionism is sexy’ and ‘Hamas is ISIS’ . The footage has since gone viral with the teenager currently trending on Twitter – leaving many alarmed and calling him out publicly. ‘Noah Schnapp is foul…. hes literally a disgrace. a “zionism is sexy” sticker?,’ a follower fumed. ’Well get out of your cushy LA pad, give up your career and go live in Israel then if you love Palestinian genocide sooo badly [sic].’ Want to be the first to hear the world’s top stories?

One called out the difference in treatment between those who had publicly supported Palestine, stating: ‘People losing their career over saying free Palestine but Noah Schnapp will be able to return to stranger things and live the rest of his life off the money from it. What the f**k.’ As a social media fan added: ‘Idgi i thought Noah Schnapp was scared how is he publicly flaunting “zionism is sexy” stickers.’ David Cameron back as Foreign Secretary after Suella Braverman was sacked Irish girl believed murdered by Hamas is being held hostage in Gaza, Israel says - latest Victim of Waterloo hate attack tells how racist thugs were 'driven by hate' Schnapp has yet to address the outrage publicly. Zionism is a movement supporting the re-establishment, and protection, of a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel. Unrest has continued to grow in Palestine over the last few weeks, after Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, leaving at least 1,200 people dead. The tensions have escalated amid retaliatory attacks, with Gazan health officials reporting that the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 11,000. Many have called for a ceasefire, with stars making their voices heard amid the brutal fighting. Gal Gadot and Amy Schumer have spoken out on social media, while Schnapp was slated for his response last month. Zionism is a Jewish political movement aimed at stamping out antisemitism by establishing a Jewish state. ‘Zion’ means Jerusalem in Hebrew, and so ‘Zionism’ centres around having a homeland in the land around that area – which at the time was Palestine, controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The land was inhabited by an Arab majority and a Jewish minority, and for a while, both groups coexisted in relative peace. But tensions mounted when Britain took on the task of establishing a ‘national home’ for the Jewish people, issued through the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Both the Arabs and the Jews claim the region as their ancestral home, and as more Jews arrived between the 1920s and 1940s, violence between both groups and British rule grew. In 1947 the UN voted for Palestine to be split into two states, one for the Jews and one for the Arabs, with Jerusalem as an international city. Israel as a state was admitted into the UN on May 11, 1948 and gained its first president Chaim Weizmann, the president of the Zionist Organization in 1949. ‘As a Jewish American, I am afraid,’ he began a lengthy statement – which is still visible on his Instagram page. ‘Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel, who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas. I am truly heartbroken to see the brutal murders of innocent children, women and soldiers fighting to defend themselves. ‘I, like others, want peace for both Palestinians and Israelis. Let’s stop the rhetoric and choosing sides. Instead we must recognize that we are all on the side of the fight against terrorism. Choose humanity over violence. ‘You don’t have to be Jewish, you don’t have to be Israeli, you just have to have empathy and common sense to know that THIS is wrong. ‘I have also noticed a silence in social media like never seen before. The same people who love to jump on fashionable causes like supporting Ukraine and combating climate change have been chillingly quiet. The Jewish people are seeing your silence and won’t forget it. ‘I hope we can agree that Hamas are a recognised terrorist organisation; they don’t represent the Palestinian people when they value murdering Israelis more than protecting their own. You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism. It shouldn’t be a difficult choice. Shame on you.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Schnapp’s reps for a comment. Got a story?

10:27:48,,"Amid the ruins, Palestinians struggle to survive in Gaza",https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/11/14/amid-the-ruins-palestinians-struggle-to-survive-in-gaza?traffic_source=rss,"In Pictures Every morning at 8am, Amal al-Robayaa leaves the United Nations school where she has taken refuge with her extended family since , on a mission to find food. “It’s the first thing I think about when I wake up: how am I going to feed the children today?” The mouths to feed include her husband, six children, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. Under the constant threat of bombardment in Gaza since October 7, Amal’s daily struggle to support her family has become a deadly assault course. She picks through the rubble between the school and her home in Shabura neighbourhood of Rafah in the south of Gaza, where she hopes to find neighbours with some flour to make bread. Her 24-year-old son Suleiman races to a nearby bakery first thing to grab a number in line, before hurrying to a water point. “I try to fill a canteen or two with water before getting back to the bakery before it opens,” said Suleiman. The tiring task “takes two hours, when you’re lucky, but more often four or five”, he said. There is no guarantee of success at the end, either. “We take turns in the line. Two days ago, I waited in the line for four and a half hours and when it was my turn, they told me there was no bread left. I begged them to give me just a few pieces for the children but they refused,” said his mother. Amal says the apartment block she lived in was destroyed by an Israeli bombardment on the first day of the war which followed Hamas’s attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s response has killed about 11,200 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. “Even the horse which pulled my son’s cart, his livelihood, was killed,” she said. The family spends the day in the rubble of what once was their home. Later, Amal is joined by her sister-in-law Nesrin, 39, who turns up holding up a small sack of flour like a trophy. The pair put themselves to work immediately, mixing the flour with water. One worked the dough, while the other scavenged in the rubble for pieces of cardboard and wood to make a fire to bake the flatbread. “Look at me! I’m helping, too!” said nine-year-old Bilal, laying out clothes to dry on slabs of concrete. What little water there is has to be used carefully, a little for washing clothes and some for a shower. “In general, the children and I wash every four or five days. Sometimes there is no water and we have to wait longer,” said Amal, gesturing to her bathroom, which still stood among the rubble. “It allows us to have a bit of privacy but we’re always worried a piece of concrete will fall on our heads,” she said. Her husband, Imed, tries to keep the children occupied, playing old Palestinian songs and some more modern tunes on the ney, the traditional Arab flute. “My oud was buried under the rubble but at least I have my flute to keep my spirits up and make the children smile,” he said. By the afternoon, the family had managed to secure 27 litres (seven gallons) of water, a 500-gram (18-ounce) bag of pasta and a packet of sauce – to be shared between some 50 people. “We start by feeding the children,” Imed said, as the younger members of the family lined up with their plates to get a few mouthfuls of food that quickly disappeared. After dinner, the parents poured themselves a cup of tea each. The little powdered tea they have left needs to last. With the sound of drones growing and darkness approaching, the family headed back to the UN school, where they sleep alongside thousands of others. “We do not have winter clothes for the children and each night now, it’s a little colder than the night before,” said Amal. “The children don’t sleep much and if they manage to sleep, they wake up in the night screaming,” added sister-in-law Nesrin. “So I spend the night waiting for the sunrise, so I can return close to home.”",top,united states of america
07:01:39,Meghna Amin,Jeremy Corbyn refuses to label Hamas a ‘terror group’ during explosive Piers Morgan grilling,https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/14/piers-morgan-grills-jeremy-corbyn-calling-hamas-a-terror-group-19819233/,"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Jeremy Corbyn failed to answer whether Hamas is a ‘terrorist group’ during an explosive interview with Piers Morgan , in which the Uncensored host asked the former Labour leader 15 times. Corbyn, 74, was questioned on his views during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, after the terrorist group launched an attack on October 7. Tensions have since escalated amid retaliatory attacks, with Gazan health officials reporting that the number of Palestinian people killed has surpassed 11,000 . During a discussion on Monday’s Uncensored , Corbyn called the attack – which he said he’d previously condemned – by Hamas ‘abominable’ and ‘appalling’, but failed to call Hamas a ‘terrorist group’. ‘And you think Israel can do peace with people who did that?’ Morgan question, leaving Corbyn frustrated as he replied: ‘If you want to have a discussion, fine. But if you want to shout at me that’s your prerogative, your TV. Your show.’ Morgan, 58, then repeatedly questioned whether Corbyn agreed with calling Hamas a terrorist group. ‘Listen, I do not approve, support or welcome Hamas,’ the Islington North MP said, but failed to directly answer the question with a yes or no. ‘Are they a terror group?’ Morgan continuously repeated, with Corbyn at first replying, ‘Everybody knows what they are’, before going on to express frustration at the host’s interrogation, asking: ‘Is it possible to have a rational discussion?’ At one point, Morgan said it was ‘very telling’ that Corbyn refused to directly answer the question, adding: ‘And you wonder why people think you had a problem with Jewish people.’ Corbyn, who has previously called on political leaders to condemn Israel’s ‘warn crimes’ in Gaza, attended Saturday’s pro-Palestinian marches in London. He went on to say the demonstrations had seen an enormous crowd of peaceful protesters of all walks of life and religions calling for an immediate ceasefire, and said there were placards calling for the release of hostages. When asked whether he condemned Hamas’ actions on October 7, he replied: ‘Of course I have, at every speech I’ve made I’ve utterly condemned the killing on October 7th and it was the taking of innocent life. Danny Dyer's epic 't***' rant against David Cameron resurfaces as he returns to government Louis Theroux pulverises Piers Morgan with fighting talk Over 500,000 protesters shut down London to demand ceasefire in Gaza ‘It was totally wrong under any circumstances. ‘You don’t bring back the tragedy of those 1,400 deaths by killing 10,000 in Gaza. ‘You have to have a process that leads to a ceasefire.’ After saying that he doesn’t ‘support’ and is ‘not a friend’ of Hamas, Corbyn told Morgan ‘it’s not up to your or me’ when asked whether he would keep Hamas in power. Last month, Corbyn called for Israel’s war crimes to be condemned as he addressed thousands at a pro-Palestine rally in London.

13:07:49,,Palestinians call for evacuation of hundreds of patients and newborns from Gaza's largest hospital,https://www.nsnews.com/world-news/palestinians-call-for-evacuation-of-hundreds-of-patients-and-newborns-from-gazas-largest-hospital-7827176,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian authorities proposed a Red Cross-supervised evacuation of a hospital beset by fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, as health officials warned that the only way to save three dozen newborns trapped there would be to call a cease-fire and transport them out of the besieged territory . After days of battles with Palestinian militants, Israeli forces have encircled Shifa Hospital , where hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people are trapped with dwindling supplies and without electricity to run incubators and other equipment. Gaza's largest hospital has emerged as a symbol of Palestinian suffering in the war between Israel and Hamas that extends far beyond its walls. Only one hospital in the territory's north is still capable of receiving patients, and about 200,000 Palestinians have streamed out of the area toward worsening conditions in the south in recent days, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday. The war, now in its sixth week, was triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into Israel, in which militants killed hundreds of civilians and dragged some 240 hostages back to Gaza. The conflict has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and wreaked widespread destruction on the impoverished enclave. Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death. She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters , and alleged that the militants have set up their main command center in and beneath Shifa. Israel says these claims are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Both Hamas and Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations, and the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility. The ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. The military said it placed fuel several blocks from Shifa, but Hamas militants prevented staff from reaching it — an allegation the ministry denied, saying instead it was too dangerous for staff to venture out. According to the ministry, 36 babies remain who are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators. The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said they would be useless without electricity and that the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza. “Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,” he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a cease-fire along the route. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said it has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response. He said 120 bodies will be buried in a mass grave inside the hospital because they are unable to safely transport them to cemeteries. International law gives hospitals special protections during war. Hospitals can lose those protections if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, but staff and patients must be given plenty of warning to evacuate, and the harm to civilians cannot be disproportionate to the military objective. On Monday, the military released footage of a children’s hospital that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement. The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people. The Red Cross tried Monday to evacuate some 6,000 people from another Gaza City hospital, Al-Quds, but said its convoy had to turn back because of shelling and fighting. DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians to evacuate Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children. Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes, and U.N.-run shelters in the south are already severely overcrowded. People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes. The onset of rainy, cold weather added to the misery. At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents. “All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,” said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. “How many days will we have to deal with this?” The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt’s Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only link to the outside world. REGIONAL TENSIONS As of Friday, more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. At least 1,200 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial Hamas attack. The military says 46 soldiers have been killed in ground operations in Gaza, and that thousands of militants have been killed. About 250,000 Israelis have evacuated from communities near Gaza, where Palestinian militants still fire barrages of rockets, and along the northern border, where Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire . The war has also fueled tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where at least seven Palestinian were killed overnight during an Israeli raid, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from the army. More than 190 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

11:43:38,Rohini  Hensman,The uncomfortable parallels between anti-Semitism and Zionism,https://frontline.thehindu.com/world-affairs/israel-palestine-conflict-anti-semitism-vs-zionism-racism-against-jews-palestinians-arabs-muslims-erodes-humanity-blocks-compassion/article67512714.ece,"“Anti-Semitism” is the term commonly used for racism against Jews, if we define “racism” very broadly as oppression of any group of people on the grounds of physical characteristics (like skin colour), language, religion, sect, caste, tribe, or ancestry. It ranges from hate-speech and discrimination to persecution, exclusion, expulsion, and mass murder. The term “anti-Semitism” may not be entirely accurate, but we will use it here because it has become widely accepted, just as “Islamophobia” is an inaccurate but widely accepted term for racism against Muslims. Abram Leon, a Jewish Marxist murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis, points out that more than three-fourths of Jews lived outside Palestine before the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans. Although Jerusalem was a place of pilgrimage for them in much the same way as Mecca became a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, the kingdom of Palestine was not of much importance. The reason for this dispersal was not violence but the lack of livelihood opportunities, which were better in other countries. Proselytisation in places where they settled turned the community into a multinational one, with members in India, Ethiopia, Yemen, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. Most of the diaspora engaged in trade. There was prejudice against Jews among the Roman aristocracy, and later among Christians, but it was only in the 12th century that this became persecution and violence in Western Europe, somewhat later in Eastern Europe. The 14th century saw the first large-scale riots against Jewish moneylenders by artisans and peasants in Europe, who saw them as the cause of their ruin without seeing the princes or bourgeois who creamed off the profits of usury. Of course, not all Jews were merchants or moneylenders, but this stereotype was propagated and created hatred of Jews. Racism was entrenched in Western and Eastern imperialist powers, since domination, enslavement and extermination of other peoples had to be justified by deeming them inferior. But the late 19th century saw the rise of a vicious blood-and-soil nationalism which abandoned rationality and democracy and was even turned against other Europeans. Notions of racial purity and anti-Semitism grew in tandem. This was the environment that shaped Hitler as a young man and led to the horror of the Holocaust. There were two responses from Jews in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century. One was an initiative to join the imperialist oppressors by creating their own settler-colony in Palestine: Zionism. As Edward Said says, “Zionism essentially saw Palestine as the European imperialist did, as an empty territory ‘filled’ with ignoble or perhaps even dispensable natives; it allied itself, as Chaim Weizmann quite clearly said after the First World War, with the imperial powers in carrying out its plans for establishing a new Jewish state in Palestine.” The other reaction was exemplified by the General Jewish Workers Union of Lithuania and Poland, better known as the Bund, which organised alongside other socialist groups to fight anti-Semitism, tsarism, authoritarianism and capitalism; they were staunchly opposed to Zionism.

But that changed when the British, instead of granting independence, handed Palestine over to the Zionist Organization in accordance with the Balfour Declaration (1917), and aggressive colonisation of Palestine by Zionists began. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe explains that the main goal of the Zionists “was the ethnic cleansing of all of Palestine, which the movement coveted for its new state”; in 1948 almost 800,000 indigenous Palestinians — more than half the population — were driven from their homes by gruesome massacres, becoming refugees in other parts of Palestine and neighbouring countries. Expulsions and massacres continued even after the Oslo Accord of 1993, leaving most Palestinians who remained in their country confined to non-contiguous ghettos in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinian residents of Israel were subjected to an apartheid regime of discrimination. The Zionist project is thus racist to the core, so how has it been accepted so widely by the supposedly democratic countries of the West? One reason is that it resonates with racism engendered by their imperialist past, which has been exacerbated by rampant Islamophobia since 9/11. The geopolitical advantages of having a white colonial ally in West Asia is appreciated especially by the US, which funds and arms Israel and vetoes every UN resolution calling for Israel to abide by international law, except in December 2016, when the Obama administration abstained from the vote on a Security Council resolution describing Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Netanyahu denounced the resolution as “anti-Israel”, and it was never implemented. Western powers proclaiming Israel’s “right to defend itself” from Hamas by slaughtering children, bombing hospitals, ambulances, schools, residential blocks, mosques, churches, bakeries, water reservoirs, and UN shelters, and cutting off 2.3 million people from food, water, fuel, electricity and medicines, is another expression of racism, making it clear that Palestinian lives don’t matter. Their support for “the two-state solution” after having done nothing to prevent hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers occupy what is supposed to become a Palestinian state is both hypocritical and racist. Are they going to evict the settlers, who are armed and even now proceeding with attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? Hardly. So where is this Palestinian state going to be?

French authorities have initiated investigations into the paintings, which are seen as anti-Semitic. | Photo Credit: Michel Euler/AP Besides, the two-state “solution” fails to abolish apartheid in Israel and ensure the right of Palestinian refugees to return. The BDS movement calling for a Boycott of Israel, Divestment from it, and Sanctions against it until it complies with international law by ensuring Palestinian sovereignty in the Occupied Territories, abolishing apartheid, and implementing the right of Palestinian refugees to return has been denounced in many of these countries. There is another driver of Western support for Israeli atrocities: guilt about the role their countries played in the Holocaust. This has given the Israeli state a powerful means of manipulating them. The Israeli state has invested heavily in extremely sophisticated information warfare or , described as “communication calculated to influence cognition and behaviour by manipulating perceptions of a cause or position with one-sided arguments, prejudicial substance, and emotional appeals…. Although includes efforts to impede access to information through a wide variety of techniques…, it focuses on limiting the receptivity of audiences to information” contradicting its narrative. Key features of are the demonisation of Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims and the message that anti-Zionism constitutes anti-Semitism. This has succeeded very well in the West, where it fits in with prevailing racism and guilt about the Holocaust. It has resulted in widespread acceptance of the open-ended International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s “Working Definition of Antisemitism”, which includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as examples of anti-Semitism. The IHRA suggests that such anti-Semitic acts should be criminalised. Unfortunately, some Palestinians also blurred the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and some of their supporters still do so. For example, as Gilbert Achcar explains, seeing the Israeli state instrumentalise the Holocaust to justify its oppression of Palestinians, they engaged in Holocaust minimisation or denial. In the first place, it is immoral to deny the enormity of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews that continues to this day. But secondly, it is also counter-productive because it reinforces the Zionist narrative. For sincere anti-racists, it is critical to define anti-Semitism accurately and show how it differs from anti-Zionism. This is what the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism sets out to do. Presented by 210 eminent Jewish scholars of anti-Semitism studies and related fields in March 2021, it now has around 350 signatories. According to them, “Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)”. They make it clear that “while antisemitism has certain distinctive features, the fight against it is inseparable from the overall fight against all forms of racial, ethnic, cultural, religious and gender discrimination”. The authors explain that the declaration is based on universal human rights principles, and is a response to two circumstances. One is the alarming resurgence of anti-Semitism by groups mobilising hatred and violence in politics, society and on the Internet, which make it imperative to have a usable, concise and historically informed core definition of anti-Semitism with a set of guidelines; and the other is the definition adopted by the IHRA, which they regard as unclear in key respects, widely open to different interpretations, and weakening the fight against anti-Semitism by causing confusion and generating controversy. They express particular concern that some of the “examples” of anti-Semitism included in the IHRA exclude legitimate political speech and action about Zionism, Israel, and Palestine. Thus, their aim is twofold: “(1) to strengthen the fight against antisemitism by clarifying what it is and how it is manifested, (2) to protect a space for an open debate about the vexed question of the future of Israel/Palestine”. Regarding Palestine/Israel, they provide five examples of views and actions that are anti-Semitic. These include: “Supporting the Palestinian demand for justice and the full grant of their political, national, civil and human rights…. Criticising or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism…. Evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state. This includes its institutions and founding principles… Thus… it is not antisemitic, in and of itself, to compare Israel with other historical cases, including settler-colonialism or apartheid…. Boycott, divestment and sanctions are commonplace, non-violent forms of political protest against states. In the Israeli case they are not, in and of themselves, antisemitic.” Palestinian workers gather at the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip on September 28, after the Israeli authorities reopened it. | Photo Credit: MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Thus, for example, if we argue that Israel is an apartheid state, we should make it clear that our objection is not simply to a state but to state linked to religion, which will inevitably be an apartheid state because it will discriminate against people of other faiths and none. And if we compare the policies of Netanyahu’s 2022 government with those of the Nazis, we need to provide evidence, as Israeli Professors Zeev Sternhell and Daniel Blatman do. Anti-Semitism is racism against Jews. Zionism is racism against Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims. Racism against group undermines democracy by violating its principles of freedom, equality and friendship. Racist states violate the democratic rights of all dissidents, not just the targeted communities, and move towards fascism unless replaced by democratic ones. At a deeper level, racism erodes our humanity by blocking our compassion for oppressed human beings who differ from us in some way. That is why we must combat both anti-Semitism and Zionism.

09:31:53,admin-dominor,Palestinian children in the West Bank are also under attack,https://turks.us/palestinian-children-in-the-west-bank-are-also-under-attack/,"While the world’s focus is on Israel’s genocidal siege and bombing campaign in Gaza, Israel is also inflicting terror on Palestinians across the occupied West Bank. At least 186 people, including more than 30 children, have been killed there by the Israeli military and settlers since October 7. And nowhere in the occupied territories has seen more military aggression than the Jenin refugee camp, which to all intents and purposes has become a warzone. Since 2018, the Brighton Trust, an English charity that I am part of, has been helping fund the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre in the camp. It is a place where children can go to learn, play and socialise. In recent weeks, many have sought refuge from Israeli bombing in the Centre, and have been sleeping there because their homes have been destroyed. Like every corner of the overpopulated camp, the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre is currently under attack. In fact, it has been under attack for a long time. In July this year, during their violent incursion into Jenin which killed 12 Palestinians, Israeli soldiers also raided the Centre and wrecked it. They not only destroyed all facilities and equipment, including children’s books, but also punched large holes into the exterior walls of the building, leaving it barely habitable. Our charity, together with the British Shalom-Salaam Trust, had to raise money to repair the building and replace equipment. Children eventually returned to the Centre, but it was clear that they were not safe there. The Israeli military was determined not to allow Palestinians in Jenin to have peace and quiet, even at a centre for children. And things got significantly worse since Israel responded to Hamas’s October 7 attack with a genocidal bombing campaign in Gaza and increasingly aggressive and deadly military operations across the West Bank. A teacher at the Al Tafawk Children’s Centre wrote to me in mid-October about the horrific situation Jenin’s children have been in since the July incursion. “We did not have one peaceful night since [July],” she explained. “When the attacks on the Gaza Strip started, the attacks on the camp became even worse. Life got so hard that it feels like we can’t breathe. The soldiers are threatening that they will do the same to us in Jenin, as they are doing to people in Gaza. Actually, they have already started doing it, but the world is too busy elsewhere, showing only the Israeli side of the story. We have only one wish today. To have just one peaceful night, without waking up with the news that a family member or an entire family got killed.” She went on to tell me about the night soldiers entered her home and detained her family for hours as they tried to capture someone in the area. “They locked us up for three hours in the bathroom,” she said. “Even my brother’s baby, who is only 15 days old, was not allowed to get milk. These things start to feel normal here, but all the children are dying from inside. They don’t understand why this is happening. We are screaming, but no one hears us.” The same teacher wrote to me once again on October 27. “Each night we lose people, children. We buried lots, but because they die after the attack, the news never mentions them! Even our cemetery was bombed.” “Our Centre is in the middle of camp, the only lovely place for children. It is now very dangerous to reach, but the children find it the only place that can help them survive. I can’t tell them we are really in danger [at the centre]!” The media only talks about the Gaza Strip. But in the West Bank, the situation is very bad as well. Cities, villages and camps are all locked down and under near-constant attack. And everyone, including thousands of children, is at risk and suffering. Israel’s excuse for its murder and maiming of thousands of Palestinians, including children, in the Gaza Strip is that it is trying to “destroy Hamas”. In the West Bank, Hamas is not in power, yet Israel is increasing the repression and the violence. It is doing so because its real objective, in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine, is not “destroying Hamas” or defeating any other enemy. Its true goal is, and has always been, ethnic cleansing. As we’ve already seen in a leaked Ministry of Intelligence document, Israel desires to annex the whole of Gaza and expel its population into the Sinai desert. The same is true in the West Bank even if, so far, the means of expelling the Indigenous population are not the same. Large areas of the West Bank had already been made Arabrein (“free of Arabs”) through the use of settler and army terror and pogroms before October 7. But in the last month, there has been an acceleration in Palestinians being forced out of their villages and homes. On October 28, the Palestinian community of in the South Hebron Hills had to pack up and leave their lands due to settler terror. This was just one of the eight communities that have been forced to abandon their homes and lands in the past four weeks. Six others have been partially evacuated after villagers have been told they will be killed if they refuse to leave. This is a pattern we have seen before. First, Palestinians in rural areas will be forced to leave their land and move into cities. Then, those in the cities will be pushed out into a third country. Israel has embarked on a second Nakba – not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. On November 9, there was yet another attack on Jenin, the most serious yet. 14 Palestinians were murdered, mostly by drones. During the attack, Al Tafawk Centre was tear gassed with the children still inside it and, according to some reports we received, live ammunition was used. Most of the children were evacuated, but about 20, owing to the inhalation of gas, were unable to. Later the same day, the teacher I’ve been in contact with risked her own life and went into the Centre to check up on the children. She found some of the children unconscious. It beggars belief how a children’s centre has become the object of a military attack unless the real goal is to destroy all Palestinian civil society organisations. On November 13, we received a distressing message from the Centre’s head teacher whose father has been arrested and beaten. She told us the Centre is barely operating because of the attacks of the Israeli army. People have no food, and many of the children don’t know what has happened to their families. The Al Tafawk Children’s Centre, and the Palestinian children trying to find peace and safety there, are now under attack. Like others in the Jenin camp, across the occupied West Bank, and in Gaza, they are being targeted, threatened and traumatised for the crime of being Palestinian, and trying to exist in their ancestral lands. They are telling us that “they cannot breathe”. That they are screaming, but no one is listening. The world cannot continue to ignore their plight. We have to help the children of Gaza, and the West Bank. We have to demand an immediate end to Israel’s brutal ethnic cleansing campaign.",world,turkey
14:00:00,,Water Corridors Helped Homo Sapiens Disperse Out of Africa,https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/water-corridors-helped-homo-sapiens-disperse-out-of-africa,"The routes that our ancestors followed out of Africa have been long debated. But now researchers have uncovered evidence that the so-called northern route — a traverse that took Homo sapiens from the Sinai Peninsula into the Jordan Rift Valley — might have been a particularly viable corridor during the last interglacial period, which persisted from about 129,000 to 71,000 years ago. Sediments unearthed at three sites in southern Jordan suggest that wetland conditions likely persisted there during that time. A water-rich landscape would have provided ample food resources in the form of both plants and animals for migrating humans. Rock Formations, Not Waterfalls Today, much of southern Jordan is a desert. It’s a landscape known not for its waterfalls but, rather, for its rock formations; the famed archaeological site of Petra is literally built into the red sandstone that abounds in the region. The climate is hot and arid, said Mahmoud Abbas , a quaternary geologist at Shantou University in Shantou, China, and a Jordanian by birth. “The mean annual precipitation is 100 millimeters per year.” But perhaps the climate in the region, which is part of an area known as the Levant , was far different in the past — that’s what Abbas and his colleagues set out to investigate. If southern Jordan was once wetter, for example, the region might have functioned as a migration corridor for humans leaving Africa. Wetter conditions in the Levant would have resulted in plentiful sources of food to sustain Homo sapiens on the move, said Zhongping Lai , a geologist at Shantou University and a member of the research team. “With water and vegetation, animals will be there.” North or South? Early modern humans may have migrated out of Africa and into the Levant during the Pleistocene through southern or northern routes, as indicated by speleothem records, paleoclimate records, paleontological sites with fossils of Homo sapiens, and archaeological sites with stone tools. Roughly 85,000-year-old fossilized human bones have been found in Saudi Arabia — southeast of the Levant on the Arabian Peninsula — but the route Homo sapiens took to get there is unclear. “There [are] two possible routes out of Africa,” explained Jon Hill , a numerical environmental scientist at the University of York in the United Kingdom not involved in the research. The northern route, via the Sinai Peninsula and the Levant, is entirely over land. The southern route, on the other hand, crosses the Red Sea. “You’d be sailing for quite a while,” said Hill. The fossil evidence is inconclusive when it comes to pinpointing which traverse was favored by our ancestors, however. Between 2017 and 2020, Abbas and his colleagues made three trips to the Levant to investigate. They focused on two sites in the Jordan Rift Valley at elevations of roughly 50 and 270 meters above sea level and one site on the Jordanian Plateau at an elevation of about 800 meters above sea level. The team did most of its fieldwork in the summer. Temperatures routinely topped 40°C, Abbas said, and gusts of wind regularly whipped up the desert dust. But in the harsh landscape, the researchers found pebbles, cobbles, and boulders in addition to sand and silt and sediments rich in organic matter. Some of the material furthermore contained traces of plant roots and other evidence of long-ago vegetation. Abbas and his collaborators concluded that wetland conditions once persisted in the area. Indeed, faint outlines of long-ago lakes have been spotted in the region . However, the big question was when all that moisture was present. To dig into that mystery, the team pushed stainless-steel cylinders roughly the size of paper towel tubes into exposed sections of sediment. With the tubes full, the researchers capped the ends to prevent the samples from being exposed to light. Mind the Light At Shantou University, the researchers worked under dim red light as they extracted the sediments from each tube. The unusual lighting conditions were necessary because the material was going to be dated using optically stimulated luminescence . That technique reveals how much time has elapsed since minerals such as quartz and feldspar in the sediments were last buried, Lai said. “It dates the event of last light exposure.” The team recorded dates ranging from 115,000 to 45,000 years ago. Those numbers are consistent with the ages of fossilized human bones and footprints discovered in the nearby Nefud Desert, the team noted. Furthermore, they overlap with the growth periods of speleothems found in a cave roughly 100 kilometers to the northwest. ( Stalagmites and stalactites grow in the presence of water — these cave formations are literally built up over time from minerals dissolved in water.) The confluence of archaeological evidence, such as stone tools, and paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic data suggests that Homo sapiens did, indeed, traverse a northern route across the Sinai Peninsula into modern-day Israel and Jordan on their way out of Africa, the team reported in Science Advances . These findings make sense, Hill said, but they certainly don’t rule out the southern route as another way out of Africa. “Humans probably did both,” he said. “We’re quite an ingenious species.” This article was originally published by Eos .",top,united states of america

PTI An Indian woman from Kashmir who had sought immediate evacuation from the war-torn Hamas-ruled Gaza has safely reached Egypt with the help of Indian missions in the region, according to her husband. Lubna Nazir Shaboo and her daughter Karima, crossed the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza on Monday evening. ""They are in al-Arish (a city in Egypt). Tomorrow morning (Tuesday) they will move to Cairo,"" Lubna's husband Nedal Toman said in a text message sent to PTI from Gaza. The only exit route from Gaza, the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has been infrequently opened the past few weeks to let humanitarian supplies enter Gaza and also let some foreign nationals and wounded people cross over to the other side. In a telephone call to PTI on Sunday, Lubna confirmed that her name was among the people who could leave Gaza and thanked profusely the Indian missions in the region -- in Ramallah, Tel Aviv and Cairo -- for making this possible. On October 10, Lubna had reached out to PTI over the phone seeking help for evacuation. ""We are facing a brutal war here and everything is being destroyed and bombarded in a matter of seconds,"" she had told PTI. Following the unprecedented attacks by Hamas militants on October 7 in the southern areas of the Jewish state, Israel declared war launching a counter-offensive with the twin objectives of ousting Hamas, which has ruled the coastal Strip since 2007, and freeing around 240 people who were taken hostage by the Islamic faction. “The sounds of bombardment are too scary and the whole house shakes. It is a very, very scary situation,” Lubna had told PTI before moving with her family to the southern part of Gaza where she spent several days with acquaintances before being evacuated. She had mentioned that their ""water supply was officially cut off"" in the middle of the night of October 9 and they were without electricity, which made them decide to move to the south and seek help in evacuation. Lubna had also said that she hadn't seen anything like this before and had two families living with them who had to run away after bombardment in the bordering areas of Gaza. “We are not able to go anywhere because there is no safe place for us anywhere and the Gaza Strip is too small and it is closed from every side. There are no exit points over here,” she said. “I have already asked for help from the Representative office of India in Ramallah to help me get to a safer place along with my husband and my daughter,” she had said in a video message sent to PTI.

13:42:20,,"‘Watch this video’, John Oliver calls for empathy on Israel-Hamas war, gets a thumbs up from netizens",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/watch-this-video-john-olivers-call-for-empathy-on-israel-hamas-war-gets-a-thumbs-up-from-netizens-101699965974115.html,"In a recent episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver delved into the complex and contentious Israel-Hamas war by highlighting the failures of leadership and underscoring the importance of empathy in any rhetoric. He started the show by reminding the viewers about ""thousands of years of generational trauma informing the response to this, including the Holocaust and the Nakba or mass violent displacement of Palestinians during and after Israel’s founding”. John Oliver on Last Week Tonight delves into the Hamas-Israel crisis Oliver criticized the common misconception that equates leaders with their citizens, emphasizing that neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Hamas represents the entirety of their respective populations. ""To assume that Netanyahu speaks for all Israelis, or that Hamas speaks for all Palestinians, because that is emphatically not the case,” Oliver stated in the show. We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join. Oliver explained how Netanyahu has covertly funded Hamas to play them off their more organized and legitimate rival, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, “Netanyahu took the risk of betting that he could control Hamas, and use them to his own ends, and he was horribly wrong about that.” He also highlighted his unpopularity, quoting polls that confirm a large majority of Israelis disapprove of his leadership. In sum, “Palestinians and Israelis have both been relentlessly let down by their leaders and the result has been a decades-long cycle of extremism, violence, retaliation and more extremism,” Oliver said. Palestinians have experienced that twice over – “subject to the inadequacies and cruelties of a Hamas government and the punishing isolation and daily miseries of an Israeli one”, caging them in a so called “open air prison” by many humanitarian groups. And the US has “emphatically picked a side” with $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, including many, many weapons used to bomb Gaza."" he emphasized. While Oliver admitted he did not have a solution for peace in the Middle East, he stressed that a ceasefire must be the first step to break the cycle of violence and extremism. “Continuing down this path only creates more extremists, which is the last thing that anybody needs."" He concluded by reiterating the crucial need for empathy and leadership different from the current status quo to address the ongoing conflict effectively. “Any conversation around this has to begin with empathy, or we’re just f**ked,” he concluded. “We know that dehumanizing people leads to violence. We know that violence leads to even more brutality and destruction, and we know that crucially, breaking that cycle is unfortunately going to require leadership significantly different than the ones currently in place.” Netizens has hailed Oliver's analysis of the Israel crisis as one on the best, “Comedians have more clarity than sold out mainstream media,” writes are follower, "".

10:04:22,BR Web Desk,IHC issues stay order against jail trial of Imran Khan in cipher case,https://www.brecorder.com/news/40273198/ihc-issues-stay-order-against-jail-trial-of-imran-khan-in-cipher-case,"Court halts proceedings of cipher case and adjourns hearing till November 16. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued on Tuesday a stay order against jail trial of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the cipher case, Aaj News reported. IHC halted the proceedings of the cipher case against the former prime minister before adjourning the court till November 16. A two-member bench, comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, announced the decision while hearing an intra-court appeal by PTI chief against his trial in Adiala Jail. Families of IK, Qureshi permitted to attend cypher trial During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Awan presented his arguments before the court from the government side. He informed that the government had approved the jail trial of Imran Khan and the notification would be presented to the court. Today’s proceedings were followed by the last week’s hearing, when PTI Imran Khan’s counsel Barrister Salman Akram Raja requested the IHC to hold an open court trial of the cipher case. PTI assails IHC for rejecting IK’s bail plea “If the general public, media, and family members of the accused intended to witness the proceedings of the cipher case, they should be permitted,” Raja said in the previous hearing. He asserted that all people would see that no offence at all was committed in the cipher case. Cipher case background A case was registered against Imran Khan and PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi under Sections 5 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923. According to the copy of the FIR registered on August 15, consequent upon the conclusion of inquiry No 111/2023 upon the complaint registered in the Counter Terrorism Wing (CTW), FIA, it transpired that former prime minister namely, Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, former foreign minister namely, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and their other associates were involved in the communication of information contained in the secret classified document (cipher telegram received from Parep Washington dated March 7, 2022, to secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to the unauthorised persons (i.e., public at large) by twisting the facts to achieve their “ulterior motives” and personal gains in a manner prejudicial to the interests of state security. Last month, the special court indicted Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cipher case .",top,pakistan

13:00:49,By Bruce Fuller,Opinion: Chinese students wonder if Biden can engage Xi with curiosity,https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/11/14/opinion-chinese-students-wonder-if-biden-can-engage-xi-with-curiosity/,"Hopes and fears have soared in the run-up to President Biden’s sit down with China’s leader, Xi Jinpeng, set for Wednesday in San Francisco. Not since the Vietnam War has America’s diplomatic dance with the People’s Republic fractured so many toes. One ray of hope shines bright — the more than 300,000 Chinese students who attend American universities, signaling the generosity of both governments. These young scholars enliven my classroom and enrich research programs around the country. Many come away with warm affection for America: our free press and raucous debates, our music and movies, even calling professors by their first name. Still, the backdrop to the Biden-Xi summit remains ominous. In recent months, the U.S. has shot down China’s spy balloon floating across the Midwest, limited technologies exported to Beijing, and implored Xi to push his ally, Iran, to defuse the bloody Israeli-Hamas conflict. Protestors will greet Xi on his arrival to California, spotlighting his oppression of writers and religion. But the wide panorama of Chinese students in the America — acquainted with both societies — offers fresh lessons. I asked several across the nation hosted by colleagues what hopes these young scholars hold for this week’s Bay Area gathering. Here’s what I heard: • Yi. Biden should express “deep respect for (Xi’s) family heritage, his father a notable figure in Chinese history (a military hero, then distributed land to rural peasants). He is quite stubborn and firmly believes in his convictions.” Biden should be “eager to advance cooperation with China openly and sincerely (in) the economy, education and health care.” • Zhang. “Opening markets would be a good thing, the return of Google. When my mother had chemotherapy, the better medicine from the U.S., with fewer side effects, was no longer available.” • Hui. “Xi emphasizes our confidence in traditional (Confucian) culture, that is, how we view the modernization process with Chinese characteristics. Traditional wisdom emphasizes harmony and development. These are common values (shared by both nations).” • Li. “The narrative in China is that America is a big bully, intervening into others’ domestic affairs. Maybe nudges are seen as condescending. I very much hope they can build trust.” • Zixi. “China should avoid misrepresenting or vilifying the U.S. in global discourse. I desire greater collaboration and mutual respect, particularly among younger generations.” America “should invite more Chinese students, perhaps with a tuition discount.” Overall, the students with whom I spoke revealed a certain savvy, expressing realpolitik over material rivalries. But they also hunger for mutual respect, for Americans to learn about their history and age-old cultural values, such as nurturing harmony and discounting oneself to cooperatively build civil society. Washington remains obsessed with stratospheric interests, such as selling semiconductors to China, cultivating allies that surround the People’s Republic. White House advisors briefed reporters last week, objectifying the Chinese people, dryly suggesting that Biden seeks to “manage the competition, preventing the downside risk of conflict.” Instead, these students invite Americans to rise above cultural caricature and grim narratives of geopolitical combat. They yearn to know us better and for us to reach out to them.",top,united states of america

Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City while Hamas denied using hospitals as hideouts. Some 240 people were taken hostage by Hamas who surged through the Gaza border on October 7 and killed 1,200 people- mostly civilians- according to Israel.

Hamas earlier said she had been killed in an Israeli bombardment but the army did not say how she died. ""Exciting news!

13:19:19,,Jewish protesters and allies stage sit-in at California federal building demanding Gaza cease-fire,https://www.nsnews.com/religion-news/jewish-protesters-and-allies-stage-sit-in-at-california-federal-building-demanding-gaza-cease-fire-7827452,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by Jewish peace activists calling for a cease fire in Gaza staged a sit-in inside of the federal building in Oakland, California, leading to multiple arrests. People wore T-shirts reading ""Jews Say Cease-fire Now” and carried banners that read “Not in Our Name” and “Let Gaza Live” in the rotunda of the Rondald V. Dellums Federal building on Monday evening. Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the protest organizers, posted online that dozens of people had been taken into custody by 9 p.m. Protesters were escorted outside of the building by U.S. Department of Homeland Security police. Messages were sent early Tuesday to the department and to Oakland police asking how many people were arrested and on what charges. “There is no other choice,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb of Berkeley told KNTV-TV when explaining why she was at the sit-in. “How many people do we have to kill before we arrive at a cease fire?” The protest was part of a growing number across the country following fighting triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel , whose response has led to thousands of deaths — and much destruction — across Gaza. On Monday, hundreds of Jewish peace activists and their allies converged at a major train station in downtown Chicago during rush hour blocking the entrance to the Israeli consulate and demanding U.S. support for an Israel cease-fire. Jewish Voice for Peace led a similar sit-in in New York City’s Grand Central Station on Oct. 27, where a sea of protesters filled the main concourse during evening rush hour, chanting slogans and unfurling banners demanding a cease-fire as Israel intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. At least 200 demonstrators were detained by New York police officers. The Associated Press",top,canada
